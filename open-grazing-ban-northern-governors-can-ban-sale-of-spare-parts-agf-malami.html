Can you deny the rights of a Nigerian?”</p><p>“For example: it is as good as saying, perhaps, maybe, the northern governors coming together to say they prohibit spare parts trading in the north.</p><p>“Does it hold water? Does it hold water for a northern governor to come and state expressly that he now prohibits spare parts trading in the north?”</p><p>He also asked the southern governors to facilitate the amendment of the 1999 constitution (as amended) to prohibit open grazing.</p><p>“If you are talking of constitutionally guaranteed rights, the better approach to it is to perhaps go back to ensure the constitution is amended,” he said.</p><p>“Freedom and liberty of movement among others established by the constitution, if by an inch you want to have any compromise over it, the better approach is go back to the national assembly to say open grazing should be prohibited and see whether you can have the desired support for the constitutional amendment.</p><p>“It is a dangerous provision for any governor in Nigeria to think he can bring any compromise on the freedom and liberty of individuals to move around.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5FpZqiolaN6qL7As6Cnn12Xrq95zaipraCVp7tus86vnKumn6fAbq%2FAp2SbmZ5iwKK4xGamn2Wjpa6zsYypmKuso2KuqLKMppilmZ2efA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emefiele-dss-boss-dragged-to-court-over-alleged-contempt.html><span>←</span><span>DSS Boss Dragged To Court Over Alleged Contempt</span></a>
