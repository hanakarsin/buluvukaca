What does she do?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Alex French downloaded TikTok in April, but she hadn't started using the app on a regular basis up until November this year. It should come as a surprise then that the high-schooler has already acquired a celebrity-like status on the app, and is often hailed as the user with the fastest-growing follower base. In the span of four weeks, Alex managed to acquire 1.3 million new fans.&nbsp;</p><p>What should we know about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> user already hailed as the next Charli D'Amelio? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Where does Alex French live?</a>&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Let's start at the basics. Where does Alex French live?&nbsp;</h2><p>According to her TikTok bio, Alex is a born and bred Texan.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she is renowned for her love of everything travel-related and has taken holidays to much-coveted destinations like Rosemary Beach, Fla., Manaus, Brazil, and Tofino, Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>She enjoys spending time on the beach and frequently visits the Richland-Chambers Reservoir and the Hamilton Pool Preserve, Dripping Springs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what should we know about Alex French?&nbsp;</h2><p>The high school student stole TikTok users' hearts with low-key, spontaneous videos that often see her do lip-synching, dance-offs and occasional character impersonations.</p><p>Alex likes to goof around a lot and her effortless, no fluff clips allow her personality to shine through all the more. Basically, she is very much a girl next door character –&nbsp;if the girl next door had the demeanor of Emma Stone and Elizabeth Banks combined. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a previous video, Alex claimed that her special talents include greeting people and catching food in her mouth.</p><p>While this might seem like a downright modest, if not misconstrued claim at first, it does happen to have a grain of truth. Alex's most-watched clip to this day —&nbsp;the one that helped her earn about 700 thousand followers overnight, bear in mind — shows Alex saying hi over and over again.&nbsp;</p><p>Although saluting people isn't a particularly complicated task, Alex elevated it into an art form on its own right.&nbsp;</p><p>Other relatively mundane chores the high school student took to the next level include jumping up and down, pantomime and sing-alongs. &nbsp;While she does engage in dance challenges every now and then — take, for instance a clip that sees her showcase some fine moves to the Lil Mama song, "Lip Gloss" — her best videos are the ones that offer a window into her personality.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Alex posts about four to five times a day on average, and her style has remained consistent since she joined the increasingly popular social media platform.&nbsp;</p><p>She shoots most of the clips while out and about, during school breaks, in the car, and at home. Her friends and sisters feature in the pieces on a regular basis, and so does her Hungarian Vizsla, Annie.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>The high schooler has already enchanted thousands of people, and it's only a matter of time until more will follow. We can't wait to see what she comes up with next.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6ido2KurbHXZp2rnZ6YtW64yK%2BcZqyZoMGwtw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apc-national-convention-slated-for-february-in-doubt-as-peace-panel-flops.html><span>←</span><span>APC National Convention Slated For February In Doubt As Peace Panel Flops</span></a>
