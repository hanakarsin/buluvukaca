However, the latest pizza hack on TikTok has left many pizza aficionados upset.</p><p>One quick scroll through the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#pizza</a> feed on TikTok and you’ll get a craving for the popular dish. With a new hack that has been circulating on the platform, you’ll likely be analyzing your pizza pies more closely. So, what does TikTok’s pizza hack consist of? Read on to get in the know.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok’s pizza hack is all about stealing a piece of a pie without anyone knowing.</h2><p>We can all agree that ordering a pizza pie comes with the assurance that you’ll be able to enjoy it in its entirety. But, the latest pizza hack on TikTok has left food lovers questioning if they've been a victim of food theft.</p><p>This hack was started by TikToker Lonely Pepperoni, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HITC</a>. In the now-deleted video, the creator shares how chefs can use a pizza slicer to cut up a pie.</p><p>But, in the midst of slicing up the pie, the chef strategically cuts the pizza down the middle and again in a slight diagonal shape. The goal is for the chef to cut a sliver of the pie and cut the remaining pizza into eight pieces.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@alex_explains href=#>@alex_explains</a><p><a title=pizza href=#>#pizza</a> <a title=math href=#>#math</a> <a title=maths href=#>#maths</a> <a title=pizzamath href=#>#pizzamath</a> <a title=freepizza href=#>#freepizza</a></p><a title="♬ how would they know bad girls club - Chris Gleason" href=#>♬ how would they know bad girls club - Chris Gleason</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>As a result, you’ll have a pizza pie that looks normal — even though a piece from the middle is missing. It's a nifty way to steal a piece of pizza without anyone knowing, but it's also a problematic revelation that has left many pizza lovers in shock.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The pizza hack has left TikTok in a frenzy.</h2><p>As the saying goes, you should never mess with someone’s family or their food. The pizza TikTok hack has proven that some chefs may have been putting one over on us and it’s not OK.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@alex_explains href=#>@alex_explains</a><p>Reply to @brenfright <a title=pizza href=#>#pizza</a> <a title=math href=#>#math</a> <a title=maths href=#>#maths</a> <a title=pizzamath href=#>#pizzamath</a> <a title=freepizza href=#>#freepizza</a></p><a title="♬ how would they know bad girls club - Chris Gleason" href=#>♬ how would they know bad girls club - Chris Gleason</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>In another TikTok, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Alex_explains</a> shows his followers how to successfully carry out the pizza hack. And as you can imagine, the comments are hilarious.</p><p>“Doordash drivers everywhere thank you for this information,” one user commented.</p><p>“How Chucky Cheese makes all their pizza,” another user commented.</p><p>On the flip side, some users have been defending the hack. HITC reports that in the comment section of the original video, users shared that the chef had a reason to cut the pizza that way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“That pie was too large to fit into that box until that slice was cut out,” a user commented. “Then it fit perfectly.”</p><p>The jury is still out on the reason for the TikTok pizza hack, but there is a way for everyone to see if they are a victim of pizza theft.</p><p>An easy way to tell if your chef removed a slice of your pizza pie is to simply see if your pizza is perfectly aligned. If the pizza pie looks uneven or the slices are mismatched, a piece of your pizza may very well have been stolen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaswM6kZKmhqq%2BubrTAnKI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./uber-eats-driver-disguised-as-man.html><span>←</span><span>Uber Eats Driver Disguises Herself as a Man to Feel Safer While Making Night Deliveries</span></a>
