Ordinary Joe actually tells the story of "a man who lives out three different versions of his existence."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>The concept might seem a little hazy, especially because most of our existences center around the dread of actually having to live a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singular timeline</a> in a species that is, by many accounts, just getting worse and worse with each passing generation. But at least we have TikTok dance trends.</p><p>The show was actually 15 years in the making, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW</a>, and was originally developed by Matt Reeves for ABC.</p><p>In Ordinary Joe, we follow a young college grad who's on the cusp of all these different choices he can make for his future. Reeves said that the idea hit him "personally" as many of us are left "wondering about the choices [we] could have made." Like if I just decided to stop eating an entire family bag size of Cooler Ranch Doritos every two days, would I be in way better shape? What a mystery.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Love this Gotta remember this one ‚Ä¶Sometimes the most beautiful dreams are the ones we have yet to dream <a href=#>#OrdinaryJoe</a> <a href=#>@ojwritersNBC</a> <a href=#>#ordinaryjoe</a> <a href=#>@nbc</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FNRg6q2X8C</a></p>‚Äî janeen perutis (@StJaneen) <a href=#>October 12, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Ordindary Joe' is ultimately about the choices we make at seemingly inconsequential moments and how that can affect our life.</h2><p>In the first episode, after Joe's graduation, he's presented with three choices. He can go and hang out with Amy, a woman he just met. Or he can go to the beach with his casual sexual partner Jenny, or he can hang with his police officer uncle to celebrate the fact he's done with school.</p><p>We learn that if he goes with Amy, he'd be married to her and a rock star 10 years later. If he decides to chill with Jenny, he'd end up married to her and a nurse working himself to death. If he parties with his uncle, he'd become a police officer who is single, but still remembers both Amy and Jenny fondly.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just look at how gorgeous they look together üòç <a href=#>#Jomy</a> <a href=#>#OrdinaryJoe</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Wgcx5b1dof</a></p>‚Äî ·¥ä·¥á ü·¥Ä (@jelevision) <a href=#>October 11, 2021</a></figure><p>Early reviews for the show are positive, saying that it manages to tow the line between "easy" watching and a large concept rather well, even if its "road not taken" intro is a bit cheesy and reminiscent of a college essay.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bobby watching Cop Joe take Amy out on a date: <a href=#>#OrdinaryJoe</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Z3qHYCamNw</a></p>‚Äî Meg üíõüíõ (Life's A Show) (@Lifesashow13) <a href=#>October 12, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Let's goooo! <a href=#>#OrdinaryJoe</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wvl8Y1DEzx</a></p>‚Äî ordinaryjoewriters (@ojwritersNBC) <a href=#>October 12, 2021</a></figure><p>Are you interested in checking out the show?
