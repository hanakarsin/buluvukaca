They are not worth it. I used to do it in the past until I applied wisdom and advised myself. Politicians have their own jobs; some are doctors, lawyers, surveyors, accountants, economists, and architects. Politics is just a game. I will not be running around for one politician, I can never, they are full of lies and deceit</p><p>“I will now be running after them because of what? I want to collect money from their hand. Politicians have jobs, even the president, Bola Tinubu, is an accountant, Sanwo-Olu, who is the governor of Lagos State is a surveyor, they all have their own professions, I am doing my own job. They are the ones that should be running after us, not the other way round. I don’t lick the feet of any of them. The only thing they know how to do is to be sleeping with our actresses”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49xZrCgqWK2br%2FTqKepnZRiv7a6zaKloGWRm8GmvoyppqWhpJ6wqq3NrGSnp5yhxri7zp1kmpukpL9uxcSmoGarn6GupbGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-tony-okocha-said-as-magnus-abe-returns-to-apc-in-rivers-state.html><span>←</span><span>What Tony Okocha Said As Magnus Abe Returns To APC In Rivers State</span></a>
