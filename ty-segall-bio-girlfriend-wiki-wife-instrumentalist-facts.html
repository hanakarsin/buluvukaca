Rex and the Grateful Dead.&nbsp;He is a multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter and record producer.&nbsp;His career, marked by his prolific nature, has spawned incredible successes and unreleased releases.</span></p><p><span>He has released albums steadily since 2007, both on a solo front and as part of collaborative efforts.&nbsp;Segall has released over ten studio albums, alongside various EPs, singles and collaborative albums.&nbsp;Furthermore, its simple yet strong melodic frameworks, creative restlessness and communicative intensity of its instrumental work further set it apart from the rest.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ty Segall: biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born on June 8, 1987 in Laguna Beach, California, and named Ty Garrett Segall, the prolific musician is of American nationality and belongs to the Caucasian ethnicity.&nbsp;Nothing is known about his biological parents, but he was raised by a lawyer and his artist wife who adopted him from an early age.</span></p><p><span>Segall was a very active child growing up.&nbsp;Although he didn’t show an interest in music until high school, he would have done well as a surfer had he continued in the sport.&nbsp;He started surfing at the age of ten, but turned to music as an escape in his teens.&nbsp;Ty Segall describes his teenage years as emotionally unstable and calls himself a very existential eighteen-year-old drinker for whom music served as a cathartic effect to his instability.</span></p><p><span>Ty Segall attended high school in Laguna Beach and is an alumnus of the University of San Francisco where he earned a degree in media studies.&nbsp;After graduating, he worked for eight months building grow boxes for cannabis plants, but focused entirely on his music career thereafter.</span></p><h3><strong><span>His career</span></strong></h3><p><span>Segall’s musical catalog is as prolific as it is diverse.&nbsp;He began his musical odyssey as a part-time musician in various underground bands and recorded a lot of success, both as a member of a band and during his solo career.&nbsp;He went solo in 2008 after garnering public acclaim as the lead singer of an Orange County, California-based garage/rock revivalist band – Epsilons.&nbsp;The musician has since released nearly a dozen studio albums, two concert albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, 19 singles and 16 music videos.</span></p><p><span>He has also worked in several side projects.&nbsp;His first solo release was the tape&nbsp;</span><span>Corne La Licorne</span><span>&nbsp;which was released on the Wizard Mountain label and later by HBSP-2X on vinyl.&nbsp;From 2008 to 2011, he released four studio albums, including a self-titled lo-fi effort,&nbsp;</span><span>Ty Segall</span><span>&nbsp;(2008);&nbsp;others are&nbsp;</span><span>Lemons</span><span>&nbsp;(2009),&nbsp;</span><span>Fondu</span><span>&nbsp;in 2010 and&nbsp;</span><span>Goodbye bread</span><span>&nbsp;arrived in 2011.</span></p><p><span>The year 2012 was rather busy for the musician with the release of three albums.&nbsp;He recorded&nbsp;</span><span>Slaughterhouse</span><span>&nbsp;with his touring band billed as the Ty Segall Band and released it on June 26.&nbsp;In April he recorded another collaborative album,&nbsp;</span><span>Hair</span><span>&nbsp;with Tim Presley of White Fence and on October 9 he released a solo album,&nbsp;</span><span>Twins.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a compilation of his varied influences and styles up to his career.</span></p><p><span>In 2013 Segall formed a new hard rock band named Fuzz with Charles Moothart and Roland Cosio.&nbsp;The same year, he released a mostly acoustic solo album titled&nbsp;</span><span>Sleeper</span><span>, in August, and Fuzz’s self-titled debut album arrived in October 2013.

Upon its release, Segall formed a backing band, a high-concept band called The Muggers.</span></p><p><span>His ninth album, an outfit of the second title,&nbsp;</span><span>Ty Segall</span><span>&nbsp;came in 2017. In it he shows his ability to play all the rock repertoire.&nbsp;As with Emotional Muggers, Segall formed another backup band, The Freedom Band, after the album’s release.&nbsp;He is also a member of the CIA, Broken Bat and GØGGS.&nbsp;His latest album,&nbsp;</span><span>Le lutin de la liberté</span><span>&nbsp;arrived on January 26, 2018.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wife or girlfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Segall married Denée Petracek Segall in 2016.
