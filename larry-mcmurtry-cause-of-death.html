The author set most of his works in Texas, which is where he was born and raised.&nbsp;</p><p>His 1986 novel Lonesome Dove, which was 843 pages, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1986. It was later made into a popular TV miniseries starring Tommy Lee Jones.</p><p>In addition to his prolific writing career, Larry had long owned a used bookstore called Booked Up, and he also adapted several of his works into screenplays.&nbsp;</p><p>Larry and his writing partner, Diana Ossana, came up with the screenplay for the 2006 film <a href=#>Brokeback Mountain</a>. The pair adapted the script from a short story by E. Annie Proulx. They ended up sharing both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award win (Larry wore jeans and cowboy boots to accept the latter award).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Nine years later, <a href=#>President Obama</a> gave Larry the National Humanities medal for his contribution to American literature.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, Larry continued to publish work with Diana; the two wrote the screenplay for the 2020 film Good Joe Bell.</p><p>Unfortunately, a spokesperson for Larry confirmed that he passed away at the age of 84 on March 25, 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Larry McMurtry's cause of death?</h2><p>According to Diana Ossana, the prolific writer passed away at his home in Texas from congestive heart failure.</p><p>He had previously undergone a quadruple bypass surgery following a heart attack in 1991. As he was recovering, Larry dealt with depression. He spent his time writing Streets of Laredo, the sequel to Lonesome Dove.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Larry McMurtry married? Did he have kids?</h2><p>Back in 1959, before he had written any of most famous works, Larry married Jo Scott. The pair welcomed a son named James McMurtry &nbsp;together in 1962 before divorcing in 1966.&nbsp;</p><p>James McMurtry is a musician and an actor. He currently lives in Austin, Texas, and he has a son named Curtis McMurtry. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Decades after his first marriage ended, Larry wed once again. He swapped vows with Norma Faye Kesey (née Haxby) in 2011 during a civil ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>Norma had previously been married to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest writer Ken Kesey. The two had three kids together. Their son, Jed Kesey, passed away from a head injury at the age of 20 in 1984.&nbsp;</p><p>Ken and Norma were married until his death in 2001.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Larry McMurty's net worth?</h2><p>Over the years, Larry discussed his propensity to spend money on antiquarian books. It was estimated that his private collection consisted of 30,000 books.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012, he auctioned off two-thirds of the works in his Booked Up storefronts. He then consolidated the business from four buildings into one.&nbsp;</p><p>In interviews, the writer was known to make jokes about money.</p><p>"I worry about where the next million dollars is going to come from," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grantland.com</a> in 2014 while promoting his book The Last Kind Words Saloon.</p><p>His frequent collaborator, Diana Ossana, told the outlet that Larry didn't get much money from his best known work.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"Larry didn't make a lot of money off of Lonesome Dove. A lot of other people did, and some of it in very nefarious ways," she explained. "That's all I'll say about that."</p><p>While some outlets estimated that Larry had anywhere between $1.5 million and $5.5 million at the time of his death, it's unclear just what his net worth was.&nbsp;</p><p>Our thoughts are with Larry's loved ones at this time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa6zvthmpJylpafBs8WMnJiuq5VivKd5w56YraA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-does-my-phone-say-not-registered-on-network.html><span>←</span><span>Why Does My Phone Say &amp;quot;Not Registered on Network?&amp;quot; Glitch Explained</span></a>
