I can liken this situation to not knowing that it is good to leave the stage when the ovation is loudest. People have argued that he has spent so much to keep the party together; did he bring the money from his house?</p><p>“This was a man who became a local government chairman, chief of staff to former River State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi, minister of state for education, supervising minister of education, and a governor on the platform of the PDP. The first time he has failed to get something, he feels that he must bring down the roof. I think it’s very selfish, wrong, and bad for politics.</p><p>“Some people have been members of the party since 1998 but have yet to realise their dream of becoming a local government chairman, despite remaining members of the party.</p><p>“So, when the party has done so much for you, why take this step? Two things contribute to one getting tickets to a party for an elective post.</p><p>“First is the belief of the people in you, and second is your personal strategy on how to get the confidence of the people. When it came down to the elements, Atiku showed that he was more politically savvy. On that day, Wike vowed to work with whoever emerged as the party’s flag bearer, so what has happened? Is he doing all this because he lost?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BqZpqsmaDCbrXTrGSvnaKuerSxy5%2BgrKBdrL%2BwusZmmKecXZeupXnFqKlmqJ%2BhtrW1wqxkqZygYrCptcSfq5qhnmK4r7vCpKpmr5mgsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adebutu-amosun-group-swear-oath-share-ogun-juicy-political-offices.html><span>←</span><span>Adebutu, Amosun Group Swear Oath, Share Ogun Juicy Political Offices</span></a>
