The country has been a host of all types of animosity – tribal, political, religious and even economical. Kenya was always on the path of war and destruction, even with the slightest triggers.

It came in the heat of the disputed 2017 election that was already spewing into violence. BBI taskforce was put in place to come up with recommendations on ways to harmonize existing institutions so that critical issues of focus are addressed inclusively. Since then, BBI has received support from the majority of Kenyans. However, it has also been opposed by some in and out of government.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0b93b7dadfa82e00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>William Ruto Owes Kenyans Apology for Years of Pay with No Work Done</span></p></a><h2>All you need to know about BBI</h2><p class=align-left>If you don’t know BBI meaning in Kenya, perhaps you should. Let's begin with some background information. On 9th March 2018, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga did the unlikeliest thing at the time. Both were bitter opponents who had engaged in name-calling for months, but, in the end, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">they agreed</a> that the country ought to come first before their interests.</p><p class=align-left>BBI team was given a one year to draft a report and provide the recommendations to the president and former prime minister. The taskforce requested for more time as they sought to visit all counties to take views from Kenyans and thus the deadline was extended to September of 2019. Here are the things you should know about BBI:</p><h3>BBI brought an end to months of protests</h3><p class=align-left>Before the handshake that gave birth to BBI initiative, opposition supporters were engaged in street protests against what is claimed to have been a rigged election. The 2017 general election was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">full of irregularities</a> which prompted the high court to order for a fresh election. The opposition had irreducible minimums they wanted to be met before the rerun election, but their conditions were not met by the electoral body.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/10cb35f4866784f6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Explained: Why Kenyans Should Not Elect William Ruto to Succeed Uhuru Kenyatta</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As a result, the opposition leader decided not to contest in the election and asked his supporters to boycott it. What ensued next was a prolonged period of protests by the opposition side and counter-protests by president Uhuru’s supporters. It had to take the handshake and BBI initiative to bring an end to the protests. BBI proposal is to be submitted to the president and former prime minister for implementation.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Handshake team proposes president be elected by college of legislatures, MPs reduced to 180</p><h3>BBI taskforce members</h3><p class=align-left>BBI task force appointed by President Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga had 14 members. The gazette list comprised of Adams Oloo, Agnes Kavindu, Senator Amos Wako, Florence Omose, Saeed Mwanguni, James Matundura, Major John Seii, Bishop Lawi Imathiu, Maison Leshomo, Senator Mohamed Yusuf Haji, Morompi ole Ronkai Prof., Bishop Peter Njenga, Rose Moseu and Archbishop Zecheus Okot. The joint secretaries of the taskforce are Amb. Martin Kimani and Paul Mwangi.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/457122c0b5cdb107.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ruto's People-Centric Campaign Model Has Forced Power-Thirsty Raila Back to Drawing Board</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0b93b7dadfa82e00.jpg><h3>BBI framework</h3><p class=align-left>The president Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga rolled out a programme tasked with implementing the shared objectives of the two leaders. The programme established an office and further retained a retinue of advisors from both sides to foresee the implementation. The programmer’s oversight was mandated to Ambassador Martin Kimani and Mr. Paul Mwangi.</p><h3>Function of BBI</h3><p class=align-left>What is the function of the BBI? BBI was given the mandate to collect data from Kenyans and offer policy recommendations on how vital contentious issues should be implemented going forward. Among the issues that were to be addressed by BBI include:</p><h4>Ethnic antagonism and competition</h4><p class=align-left>Ethnic division is the big elephant in the room in Kenya. The relationship between various communities seems to deteriorate with time and has always been a narrative of us against them. Communities have antagonized one another and are often in unhealthy competition. Therefore, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga sought to urge Kenyans to engage in healthy competition devoid of ethnic profiling.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6f796453c680f82d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review For October 18: Uhuru, Raila Arranging a 2002 Narck-like Coalition to Win in 2022</span></p></a><h4>Lack of national ethos</h4><p class=align-left>There is a fear that Kenya has been defined internationally by its negative politics and the challenges that come along with it. Corruption and violence are synonymous with Kenya when it comes to the international community.</p><p class=align-left>Even though Kenya is home to many positive attributes, citizens have failed to define and promote their national ethos. BBI was challenged with establishing how Kenyans could enjoy nationhood and patriotism through common characteristics, beliefs, and aspirations.</p><h4>Inclusivity</h4><p class=align-left>Inclusivity has been identified as one of the biggest challenges Kenyans face. Diversity has been used to divide the country instead of uniting it. Kenyans are separated by geographical location, language, and religion, among other things.</p><p class=align-left>Many parts of Kenya feel left out and alienated by the significant communities, especially those that have been in leadership positions. BBI was tasked to ensure that public institutions are accountable and impactful to all Kenyans at the national and county level.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/64c623b4b8db80ec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review for October 11: Mt Kenya May Not Back an Outsider after All</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>William Ruto says leaders using BBI to divide Jubilee will fail terribly</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/10cb35f4866784f6.jpg><h4>Devolution</h4><p class=align-left>Devolution is the major talking point from the Kenyan 2010 constitution. In as much as it has had its successes, several impediments have hindered the devolved units from serving their constituents effectively. There have been calls for the national government to relinquish some powers and more funds to the county governments.</p><p class=align-left>Some governors have even suggested that they should be in charge of the security apparatus within the counties. Devolution has also led to exclusivity in counties where some communities find themselves isolated by the people in those counties, thus creating marginalization.</p><p class=align-left>County governments are also struggling to be economically viable. Some of the suggestions that have come across as a remedy for this situation is for counties to coordinate their development plans in clusters defined by geographical and economic sectors.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/67a570c3944ca09b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review: William Ruto Blames State House For Turning Down Bishops' Call For Dialogue</span></p></a><p class=align-left>BBI was formed to work under the guidance of the president and former prime minister to promote a universal approach that will help Kenyans understand the role of devolution in contributing to the development of the nation.</p><h4>Divisive elections</h4><p class=align-left>Elections are an emotive issue in Kenya. The cycle of elections has unfortunately tended to be accompanied by violence. The country gets almost crippled during campaigns and even long after the election exercise is completed. It impacts on investment and economic activity apart from being a threat to human life. Divisive elections have cost Kenyans their jobs and livelihoods, and the ethnic polarization is not suitable for development.</p><p class=align-left>With the help of BBI, Kenya should be able to overcome the negative cycle by understanding that in itself, an election is not the solution to the national challenges. Kenyans ought to adhere to the constitution and the laws of the land. This way, it would be easy to bring an end to ethnic antagonism and profiling while promoting inclusivity, devolution, and transparency.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/35bd0a0f8fd9415f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 major BBI proposals that you need to know about before the referendum</span></p></a><h4>Safety and security</h4><p class=align-left>It is a core mandate of the government to assure Kenyans that they are safe and secure. Unfortunately, many Kenyans are left to the mercy of natural and human-made disasters. Kenyans are in constant battles with hunger and drought.</p><p class=align-left>Lives are under threat, and that is why there is a need to initiate practical efforts to ensure that Kenyans in distress are accorded the aid they need. Solutions should be advanced for warring communities to reject violence and embrace alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. The government is also to work with Kenyans to unite them against terrorism and related challenges.</p><h4>Corruption</h4><p class=align-left>Corruption has been identified as an existential threat to Kenya. It is not only destroying lives but also dwarfs public trust and prosperity. It is a generational phenomenon in the country since independence, and now it is being passed to the young generation. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Corruption has shattered </a>the hopes of young people to forge an honest and proud living.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9335fbef7af920e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daniel arap Moi: 15 things we won't forget about the former president</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The evil has undermined both public and private institutions alike necessitating urgent action if any hope is to be restored. This fight has to receive the backing of both political leaders and the citizens for it to succeed.</p><p class=align-left>BBI represents a new dawn in Kenyans politics as the task force tries to fiend long-term solutions to critical challenges such as divisive elections, corruption, and negative ethnicity. The awaited report will give way forward and is seen as what will unite the country once and for all.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Building Bridges Initiative dismiss claims it has recommended post of powerful prime minister</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkWlobG9drLWiwIybmaJllauys8XToaCnn12gu7DDjaGrpqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-2023-northern-governors-speak-on-buharis-preferred-candidate.html><span>←</span><span>Northern Governors Speak On Buhari's Preferred Candidate</span></a>
