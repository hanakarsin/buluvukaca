Two goals from Christian Pyagabara earned the Oluyole Warriors a 2-0 win over their visitors.</p><p>The 2-0 win over Remo Stars is the club’s first victory over the Ogun state-based club in seven years.</p><p>After the unprecedented win, Gbenga Ogunbote told reporters that the win was dedicated to the club’s fans.</p><p>“It was a tension-soaked game, and I’m happy that the boys were able to hold their nerves to win,” Ogunbote said.</p><p>“The win is for the club’s fans who have stayed true to the team and believe we can turn things around when we started slowly.”</p><p>The win over Remo Stars is Shooting Stars’ 11th win in 26 league games after a shaking start to the 2023-2024 season. Before the win, the Oluyole Warriors have recorded 7 draws and 8 defeats.</p><p>They are now sitting in sixth place with 40 points in 26 games, just 6 points away from first-placed Lobi Stars. This means that they now have the opportunity to at least grab a CAF competition ticket and even win the league.</p><p>“When we were 13th in the NPFL table, I said we were still on course to nick a CAF spot. Then we had 19 games but now we have 12 games and we are confident of achieving it by the end of the season”, Ogunbote said.</p><p>“Anything can happen, we all know this and it’s achievable to get the continental ticket with 12 games left.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5ByZqeolqF6tLTOqKuippdiwLWt0axksKGeYry3sdFmqZ6ln2LAta3RrGSsqJGnuLR5wqilraGemru1rctmq6Kbm5rBbrTOqZxmnp%2BnerCz1KeZqKyVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chacha-ekes-husband-austin-speaks-on-allegation-of-domestic-violence-in-their-marraige.html><span>←</span><span>Chacha Eke's Husband, Austin Speaks On Allegation Of Domestic Violence In Their Marraige</span></a>
