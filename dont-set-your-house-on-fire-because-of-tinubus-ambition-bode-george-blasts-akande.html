The attitude that he displayed is not acceptable in a civilized society. Is it his legacy to dishonour Yoruba elders?” the statement reads.</p><p>“At his age, Akande should not set his house on fire because of Tinubu’s ambition. I felt very bad as a Yoruba man and as a Nigerian. He has maligned Yoruba elders and highly respectable people in the country.</p><p>“He was busy giving kudos to Bola Tinubu. Baba Akande is from Osun State and Tinubu is the only man that he could single out to praise.</p><p>“From the reaction to his book, you must have heard what Baba Adebanjo said. How are we going to be regarded by others? Is that the right thing to do?</p><p>“Baba Akande should withdraw the book that he has authored. It is very shameful. He is older than me and I don’t expect an elderly person to behave in that manner. He must apologize to those he has offended.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5BwZp2nnql6tLHTZrCoraJitbDB0p5kqKZdm7azsYybnJyZpaiybrvFZquipqWXwrR5wKaZoqyZpLturs6dnGaflaS%2FqLGMm6Oaq6SoeqK3wKebnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aziz-shavershian-html.html><span>←</span><span>Aziz Shavershian - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>
