We are not against Mr President, neither are we against the minister, but our desire is that the good work of Adepoju should be allowed to continue. Removing him at this point would terminate these processes and take NIPOST back to square one, which we are against. We have over 13,000 employees here, once it is crumbled, it will add to the issues of insecurity in the country,” Daily Trust quoted Nehemiah saying.</p><p>“Allow us to work with the person that has understood this organization. Allow us to join hands with him to take this organization to the level that it would generate revenue for the nation. This is our cry and demand. The only condition that can make us go back to our offices and work is for the appointment that was made last week to be cancelled,” he reportedly added.</p><p>However, Odeyemi reportedly arrived at the NIPOST headquarters around 1 p.m. and walked into her office to hold a meeting with top Directors.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> learnt that she refused the chair that was offered to her and opted to sit elsewhere. Odeyemi is the first female to be appointed NIPOST CEO.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe5BvZpuqlZa4qrrGZqWer12jtrG70q1knJ2fYrylsdiepKJllJa%2Fpr%2BMmp6gqpmaw6awjLCmq6OVp8BuvsSsrKado2KxtsDYZpimoZRivbO7056qrWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-yachty-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Yachty - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
