"His last few hours were some of the most amazing moments I know I will ever have the privilege of witnessing."</p><p>Lauren continued, "We are only here for a short amount of time, and we have to live like there is no tomorrow. I want us to all be a little more like Sam. He was strong. He was the most compassionate person in the world. He would go without to help a stranger. He was a great dad."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What was J.J. Suddeth's cause of death?</h2><p>At the time of writing, J.J. Suddeth's cause of death remains undisclosed.
