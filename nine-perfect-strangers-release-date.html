She helped launched the miniseries revolution with <a href=#>Big Little Lies,</a> and has continued to star in other TV productions in the years since that show's first season. Now, Nicole's latest project, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nine Perfect Strangers</a>, is almost set to premiere, and audiences are eager to learn more about it, including its release date.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Nine Perfect Strangers' is adapted from a novel by Liane Moriarty.</h2><p>Much like Big Little Lies, Nine Perfect Strangers is also adapted from a novel by Liane Moriarty. The show also reunites Nicole with the showrunner of Big Little Lies, David E. Kelley. In addition to Nicole, the series also stars Melissa McCarthy, Michael Shannon, Luke Evans, Regina Hall and Manny Jacinto.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>The novel and series will tell the story of a wellness retreat that goes horribly wrong. Nicole is set to play the leader of the wellness retreat, who exerts control over the minds and bodies of her guests. As the trailer for the series suggests, things are going to get weird on this retreat pretty quickly. The series looks to be another dark, sinister entry in Nicole's canon of miniseries.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When is the release date for 'Nine Perfect Strangers'?</h2><p>Hulu previously confirmed that Nine Perfect Strangers will come out this year, but didn't initially give an exact release date. Now, however, we know that Nine Perfect Strangers will be dropping on the streaming service starting Wednesday, August 18. Presumably, we'll get one episode every Wednesday until all eight episodes have aired. We can't wait!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Nicole Kidman bought the rights before the book was released.</h2><p>After the enormous success of Big Little Lies, it seems that Nicole was eager to jump on whatever Liane was releasing next. Before the book was even published, Nicole had already acquired the rights to it, and was always positioned as a likely star for the project as well. Given Nicole's work thus far, and the all-star cast that's been assembled for the project, fans are eager for an announcement of the show's release date.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Jonathan Levine, who directed Long Shot and 50/50, is set to direct all eight episodes of Nine Perfect Strangers, and he'll also serve as an executive producer on the series. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Nicole explained that the production was following strict COVID-19 protocols to keep the cast and crew safe.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s an ensemble, so 10 actors that are all working together, that are adjusting to being tested every day,” she explained. “There’s really strict protocol. But you always know that at some point it could shut down, which is stressful. As an actor, it’s just amazing to be able to work. But as a producer, there’s an enormous amount of stress, feeling responsible for over 300 people’s safety and health.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7avsYypnKuelZjBbr%2FTq5inn5WnwG6%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ff7-remake-stairs-or-elevator.html><span>←</span><span>Should You Take Shinra's Stairs or Elevator in 'Final Fantasy 7 Remake'?</span></a>
