Instead, it's a sad-boy ballad in which the <a href=#>Don't Worry Darling</a> star reflects on a previous relationship.</p><p>In the three minute song, Harry mourns one of his past relationships that, for some reason, didn't work out. The chorus consists of Harry singing that he's "just thinking about" them and their "delicate point of view."</p><p>Obviously, Harry has some regrets about how this relationship ended, noting in the third verse that he "disrespected" and ultimately lost this person because he "jumped in feet first" and "landed too hard."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>We have to say, the last bit of the chorus is bittersweet.</p><p>In the last three lines, Harry sings that he's not "worried about" where this person is, or who they will go home to. Finally, he's moving on from the "what ifs" and no longer questioning what he could've done differently in the relationship.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It took a lot of growth for Harry to get to this moment, and now he doesn't pay as close attention to them as he used to. Ultimately, Harry is just grateful he crossed paths with this person and had them in his life at some point. OK, we're crying!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"Little Freak" hit the Harry Styles stans right in the feels.</h2><p>Let's be honest: None of us expected "Little Freak" to hurt so much. We were all ready to have a brand-new summer bop, but instead, we received a melancholy tune about the one who got away.</p><p>Now, we're not complaining — "Little Freak" is one of our favorites on the album, but like millions of other fans, it just really shocked us. With that said, let's look at a few reactions to fans listening to the song for the first time!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"'Little Freak' is absolutely not what my perverted mind expected," one fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on Twitter.
