There is absolutely nothing in the report, circulating, to change our mind that there was a massacre at the Lekki tollgate.</p><p>“The report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the Federal Government and its agencies without foolproof evidence.</p><p>“The federal government has never condoned the abuse of the rights of Nigerians by security agencies under any guise, hence it disbanded SARS.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FsZpuqlZa4qrrGZpinp6SdsrN5xZqinmWemsS0ecWgZKudo6W8r7DSZquoZZyWtLC%2FjKOsnaGTnq6tec%2BapZ6kXaeysbvRrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-why-osinbajo-didnt-attend-tinubus-campaign-flag-off-in-plateau.html><span>←</span><span>Why Osinbajo Didn't Attend Tinubu's Campaign Flag-off In Plateau</span></a>
