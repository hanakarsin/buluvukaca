Is there a reason the green uniforms are back? Or do the Eagles just want to try something new?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why are the Eagles wearing Kelly green uniforms?</h2><p>Each season, NFL teams are allowed to wear alternate jerseys and, as of 2022, alternate-color helmets as well. With that said, the Philadelphia Eagles are taking full advantage of the rules and bringing back the fan-favorite Kelly green uniforms for two home games: Week 7 against the Miami Dolphins and Week 12 against the Buffalo Bills.</p><p>Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie knows just how long the fans have wanted the Kelly green uniforms to return to Philly, and he couldn't be more excited for what's to come next.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the return of Kelly green uniforms in July 2023: "We are thrilled to bring back the Kelly Green uniform and helmet this season, and are equally excited to celebrate our team's history with Eagles fans everywhere."</p><p>"This is something we have wanted to do for a long time," Jeffrey added, "and from the feedback we have gotten from our fans, we knew they felt the same way. It was always important to us that we align the Kelly Green helmet with the classic throwback uniform of this era. The league's recent rule change around alternate helmets allows us to do that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: X / @Eagles</a></figure><p>Philadelphia Eagles president Don Smolenski said he and everyone else in the front office "recognize and appreciate the connection Eagles fans have to the Kelly green uniform." He continued, revealing that these uniforms "honor our past and the many legends who have helped shape our franchise along the way."</p><p>In addition, Don said the Kelly green uniforms also "represent the passion of our incredible fans and the generations that have been authentically linked by them."</p><p>We're not the biggest Eagles fans, but we can't deny how beautiful the Kelly green uniforms are. So, here's to hoping the Eagles go 2-0 in the Kelly green uniforms because we all want to see them again in the seasons to come!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecCrnGadkZy5pr%2BMsJyaqpmjtG6z0Z6cpw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pet-owner-names-dog-stupid.html><span>←</span><span>Man Gets Mad at a Pet Owner for Naming Their Dog Stupid</span></a>
