I’m not doing anything right, except what God has given me the grace to do. I believe that the reason I still hold my marriage dearly is because of maturity. I didn’t come into the industry when I was 21, so that makes the difference. When you come into this game at a young age, you may have issues. I have never said this before but I believe that if I had come into this game at a younger age, I would have left my husband; it’s very possible. I have two beautiful children (19 years and 17 years old), and a husband who loves me dearly and supports me as best as he can as a man. He also trusts me enough. He’s in the States with my children. I go home and spend 60 percent of the time and sometimes 40 percent of the time because he trusts me and I trust him</i>.”</p><p>Addressing the issue of how she copes with sexual advances from the opposite sex she disclosed that no amount of money from a man would make her forget her marital bliss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5tk2bmubgs3.jpg><p>Shaffy Bello said: “<i>I&nbsp;have just answered your question. I’m a beautiful woman by the grace of God. I know that, and nobody needs to tell me. The thing is if you are waiting for acknowledgement from someone, then it becomes a problem. That person gives you that acknowledgement and it becomes a big deal. I have someone who gives me that compliment every day. He tells me I am beautiful</i>.”</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>I Have Found Mr Right- Yvonne Nelson</p><p>Adding that “<i>I know who I’m&nbsp;and what I carry, so I carry it with pride. I’m a hardworking woman; and that is the number one thing. As a hardworking woman, a man is only coming to give me more. If a guy comes and gives me 10 million Naira, I would spend it. But what I will not finish spending is my marital bliss. I want to grow old with my husband. I want to be 65 and sitting with my husband and talking about my 20 years&nbsp;old marriage with him</i>.”</p><p>Shaffy Bello further added that in the next five years, she hopes to have grown in every aspect of her life and being a mother, she added her by the time her daughter clocks 24 years she would walk up to her saying she is ready for marriage.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3eCj3BsZqFdrLy2uMNmn5qulWKxqsLOq5qenF2ixm601KyZmqaUYruwuMuyrqinlGKupMDRnqqsZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-evolve-cosmog-pokemon-go.html><span>←</span><span>You Can't Achieve Cosmog's Final Evolution in 'Pokmon GO' (Yet)</span></a>
