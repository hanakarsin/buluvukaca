A new season of The Bachelor has officially begun and one contestant that is already making waves with her fellow competitors for a shot of stealing Peter Weber's heart is Hannah Ann Sluss. The southern belle was awarded the pilot's first impression rose on the Season 24 premiere, but a few women were upset with the Tennessee native's not-so-subtle tactics."><meta name=author content="Almeda Bohannan"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The 23-year-old and Bachelor star bonded over their similar family values and the two even shared a kiss during the night.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>In the show's history, the first impression rose typically foreshadows that the person will make it far into the ABC dating competition. So, can fans expect Hannah Ann to possibly win this season of The Bachelor?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Hannah Ann Sluss win The Bachelor and fly away with Peter?</h2><p>According to Reality Steve, <a href=#>Hannah goes far in the competition</a> and even will make it to finale night alongside Madison Prewett. However, the spoiler guru revealed on his podcast that this is not a typical ending for the show. "I can say with about as much certainty as possible that this was not a normal ending this season," he said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Adding: "What I know is on November 17 [the date that the finale was filmed] there was not: Hannah shows up, Madison shows up, he dumps one and gets engaged to the other. Did not happen."&nbsp;</p><p>So, while it's unclear who Peter will choose (if any), it seems Hannah Ann's time in the mansion is not short-lived.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Peter Weber defended Hannah Ann from fellow Bachelor Nation stars.</h2><p>During the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor Happy Hour</a> podcast, Rachel Lindsay and Becca Kufrin compared Hannah Ann to Bachelorette bad boy Luke Parker (You know, from Hannah Brown's season). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve only seen one episode. But you know who Hannah Ann reminds me of in the way you talk about her?‚Äù Rachel said. ‚ÄúEverybody say it with me now: One. Two, Three! Luke P!‚Äù&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>However, Peter was quick to defend his possible new girlfriend, saying, ‚ÄúNo, not even close. Not even close. Don‚Äôt even go there."&nbsp;</p><p>He added: ‚ÄúThat girl knew exactly what she wanted coming into this and never let me question that. And I literally mean that from the beginning. She was the first person to steal me away for the first conversation. She was the first kind of normal kiss. Not from like the first entrances. We clicked immediately.‚Äù &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hannah Ann is friends with a fellow Bachelor alum.</h2><p>If you stalked Hannah's Instagram (like we did), you'll see a familiar face on her social media. The model is good friends with BIP star Hannah Godwin. In April, Hannah Ann posted a selfie of the two, which she captioned: "Life is better with true friends, especially a friend that you have dance parties with in your hotel room. Love ya smurf."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Life is better with true friends üíê especially a friend that you have dance parties with in your hotel room üòÇ Love ya smurf üíô</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Hannah Ann</a> (@hannahann_sluss) on Apr 25, 2019 at 5:40pm PDT</p></figure><p>Chris Harrison revealed on ABC's "Meet the Women" video that Hannah G. suggested her bestie go on the show. The longtime host also suggested that Hannah Ann will be at the center of the drama this season. ‚ÄúShe seemed very naive about this whole Bachelor world,‚Äù he began.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding: ‚ÄúFor someone who is so naive and innocent, she ended up in the middle of absolutely everything.
