Prices for basic necessities have risen by an exponential rate all while workers continue to be plagued by staggeringly low salaries and abysmal minimum wage that are wildly disproportionate to both labor performed and the cost of living. With folks positing that the U.S. is in one of the worst economic <a href=#>depressions</a> in history, we're all feeling it in our wallets.</p><p>To that end, one group of coworkers isn't afraid to put their own bank accounts on blast. In a <a href=#>TikTok</a> that has gone wildly viral with more than 2.2 million views as of this writing, employees show off their distressingly low <a href=#>bank account</a> statements on the day before payday. Honestly? We can't help but share in that struggle. Here's what these folks were willing to share.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@linktlickr_</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">These employees showed off how low their bank accounts were on the day before payday.</h2><p>In a TikTok posted on Oct. 5, 2023, Sirena on TikTok (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@lintlickr_</a>) posted a video that has become wildly popular in a way that hurts us in our wallets. This short but biting video showed what several employees had in their bank accounts on the day before payday.</p><p>To Sirena's credit, the video itself is pretty tasteful. They made sure that everyone covered up their personal information and even took the extra step of having no faces in the video to keep things confidential. That said, we honestly weren't surprised to see how relatable these bank statements were.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@lintlickr_ href=#>@lintlickr_</a><p>Our bank accounts the day before paydayüòÇüòÇüòÇ and we still managed to uber eats chicfila and starbucksü§£ <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=payday href=#>#payday</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Glamorous - Fergie" href=#>‚ô¨ Glamorous - Fergie</a></figure><p>The video starts off with someone who had only $37.10 left in their bank account. Another person had a little over $20 left in their checking while another had only $18.68. Already, we feel as if payday can't come fast enough for this person, but it only gets worse from there.</p><p>The person right after that had only $5.72 in the bank. Other people were also stuck in the single digits with bank statements showing off $6.99. One person was even in the red with -$66.92 left to their name.</p><p>In a shocking reveal, one had us envious with more than $2,300 left in their checking account.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@linktlickr_</a></figure><p>Now, there are all sorts of reasons why people could be left with this little money in their checking account. Between <a href=#>rent</a>, utilities, groceries, and other essential payments, these can all present a considerable strain on people's bank accounts.</p><p>Whatever you've spent money on between one payday and the next, there's absolutely no judgment on these low bank statements. In fact, we aren't even judging the fact that some of the folks in the video got Uber Eats and <a href=#>Starbucks</a> after showing off their bank accounts. We need some "treat yo' self" energy somewhere in a crisis like this.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@linktlickr_</a></figure><p>In fact, people shared in that same despair in the comments section.</p><p>One person wrote, "Let's normalize $5 bank accounts."</p><p>Another commented, "Me spending my last $3 on a Twisted Tea cuz it's almost payday."</p><p>Many were even envious of the person who had more than $2,000 left in their bank before payday.</p><p>"I want to be Rosalia when I grow up," one person admitted.</p><p>These workers have proven that all of us are in it together when it comes to hanging on until that next coveted payday. These employees showed their bank accounts before payday, but their credit card balances probably aren't looking great either. The struggle is real right now for many people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66vt4yampynpaPBtHnBnp2oqpVivaLFw5qw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./223174-extremely-controversial-video-emerges-showing-uhuru-ruto-giving-ksh-70-milli-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Controversial video emerges showing Uhuru and Ruto giving KSh 70M in cash in a Harambee</span></a>
