Is the movie based on a true story?</h2><p>Harry Styles and <a href=#>Florence Pugh</a> join forces to deliver a mightily strong portrayal of Alice and Jack, a married couple whose idyllic relationship is challenged. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, the main source of conflict stems from Jack's job for the so-called Victory Project, which appears to be as horrendous as <a href=#>Severance's Lumon Industries</a> at first sight.

At this stage, specific details about the plot are far and few between. By the looks of it, Don't Worry Darling might be based on an original script. The lack of "story by" category on IMDb suggests that Don't Worry Darling isn't based on a book or a true story.</p><p>"I want you to imagine a life where you have everything you could want," Olivia told the crowds gathered together at Las Vegas's Caesars Palace on the penultimate day of CinemaCon 2022, via Variety. "Not just material, tangible things … like a beautiful house, perfect weather and gorgeous cars. But also the things that really matter, like true love or the perfect partner or real trusted friendships and a purpose that feels meaningful."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"></figure><p>"What would it take for you to give up that life, that perfect life. What are you really willing to sacrifice to do what’s right?" she added.
