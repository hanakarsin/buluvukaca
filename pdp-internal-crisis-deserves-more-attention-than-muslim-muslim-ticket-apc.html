That party – PDP – is crippled completely by their own internal crisis. That is where the attention should be.</p><p>“They are the one who has shortchanged our idea of rotation and power balancing between the north and the south. They took their presidential candidate from the north. We took it to the south because our party believes in fairness.</p><p>“We have a president who is from the north of the country and we thought for good reasons – to balance up the need for peace, unity and inclusiveness in this country that we cede our presidency to the south.</p><p>“We have done that but the PDP did the exact opposite to go north. Those who do not want to actually face the truth would rather discuss whether is about the Muslim-Muslim ticket or other things to distract from the fundamental breach of their own constitution.</p><p>“They are the only party that entrenched the principle of rotation in their constitution but in flagrant breach of that principle, they pushed the presidency to the north. It is up to Nigerians to decide whether the need for unity is sufficient to actually reject the call by that party to be voted into office come next year.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FpZqmcoGK2r8DEq6WapF2Yv6q%2FyKxknZ2jmr%2B3sdJmpKiqlWKutcDEp6uip55iwamtzWakrqucnrpuudSso6KlXam2pLfErWSaqJNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karl-jacobs-html.html><span>←</span><span>Karl Jacobs - ge, Famille, Biographie</span></a>
