But their marriage was short-lived. Files from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Warren County Family Court</a> in New Jersey indicate that the two divorced in 1993.</p><p>In the filing, Adrienne accused Charles of "extreme cruelty." She noted that her ex-husband was easy to anger and had previously zipped her small dog up in a bowling bag.</p><p>"I was awakened many nights by the screams of these dogs. Charlie was in the basement "training' and beating them if they did not listen to him," Adrienne wrote in her complaint, which ultimately resulted in a restraining order.</p><p>Not much is known about Adrienne's personal life today, as she's kept her personal life tightly under wraps. The same can be said for the former couple's children.</p><p>But where are they now?
