It does not matter the area of specialization one wants to pursue. These are the basic qualifications that offer students an opportunity to pursue a medical course at the university.</p><p class=align-left>The qualification for joint admission board(JAB) students depends on whether students meet minimum university requirements. Besides that, they should meet enrolment requirements which depend on the KCSE cluster subjects for specific courses. These are as follows.</p><h3>Alternative A</h3><ul><li>Biology</li><li>Chemistry</li><li>Physics/Mathematics</li><li>English/Kiswahili</li></ul><h3>Alternative B</h3><ul><li>Biological sciences</li><li>Physical sciences</li><li>Mathematics</li><li>English/Kiswahili</li></ul><p class=align-left>Besides JAB, there is the self-sponsored module II. The University Senate determines the admission to the Module II programmes through the school admissions committee. The admission for this category is based on the set minimum requirements for each program.</p><p class=align-left>Basically, K.C.S.E. holders must have scored As in the regular program. It is also important to have an average of B- (minus) in the 4 cluster subjects discussed above, as long as no subject in the cluster shall have a score below C+ (plus). With these minimum grades required for medicine courses, students can apply knowingly to increase their chances of admission.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cf901252e0d7fbe9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of top D+ courses in Utalii College to enrol this year</span></p></a><h2>Medicine courses at UoN</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9ce807513b24c55d.jpeg><p class=align-left>The best university to study medicine in Kenya offers several courses at different levels.
