Aside from A-list actors being able to land iconic roles, having a magnified sense of star power works in their favor to score brand partnerships, awards, and more. Since actors work so hard to showcase their skills and become part of the privileged bunch, being able to gain longevity in Hollywood is a gift within itself. However, actor <a href=#>Andrew Garfield</a> is having a change of heart.</p><p>Over the years, the 34-year-old has captivated audiences in his roles in The Amazing Spiderman, Under the Silver Lake, Mainstream, and plenty of other projects. In fact, Andrew even scored two Academy Awards nominations in 2017 for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his work in Hacksaw Ridge and the same for his work in Tick, Tick... BOOM! in 2022. However, it appears that the Social Network star is taking a step back from the spotlight. So, why did Andrew Garfield quit acting? Here’s everything that we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Andrew Garfield is reportedly taking a step back from acting for multiple reasons.</h2><p>Everyone deserves to rest! According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Andrew recently shared his plans of taking a break from the acting world. The news follows Andrew’s busy year of starring in various projects including Tick, Tick... BOOM! and Spiderman: Now Way Home in 2021.</p><p>“I’m going to rest for a little bit,” Andrew told the outlet in an April 27, 2022 interview. “I need to recalibrate and reconsider what I want to do next and who I want to be and just be a bit of a person for a while.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>andrew garfield: “I need to take a break and just be a person for a while”</p><p>me: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PnLPWNFXrm</a></p>— tick, tick...

After all, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> reports that Andrew is allegedly slated to land the lead role in the Brideshead Revisited miniseries, which reportedly casts Ralph Fiennes, Joe Alwyn, and Cate Blanchett.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Andrew Garfield has accumulated an impressive net worth over the years.</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth,</a> Andrew has earned a net worth of $16 million throughout the course of his career. This figure is directly linked to his profession as an actor.</p><p>Andrew first got his start in acting with a role in 2005 series Sugar Rush. The British-American actor then appeared in an episode of Dr. Who, which the outlet shares propelled his career. Once Andrew landed his first role in the U.S. market in the 2017 film Lions for Lambs, the rest was history.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The 34-year-old has gained notoriety for his acting skills in the 2010 film The Social Network, where he played Eduardo Saverin. Andrew is also revered as one of the best actors to play Spiderman after his performance in the 2021 film.</p><p>Since Andrew has quite the extensive resume, it makes sense that a break from entertainment is needed. However, fans can rest assured that Andrew will return to Hollywood when he’s ready.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aZnpm%2FpsOMoJirnpmauaV50K6grWWRmMGqusY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./slothnacs-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sloth Nacs - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
