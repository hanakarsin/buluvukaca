Is Mitch an actor himself? Yes!</p><p>On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, Mitch posted about the first movie he and Tori were both cast in, noting, "If you ever wanted to see Tori break my heart — tonight is your night!"</p><p>The film? You May Kiss the Bridesmaid. If you want to catch the lovebirds onscreen together, you can stream the film on the Roku Channel.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>A cursory scroll through both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tori</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitch's</a> respective Instagram pages reveal that the couple were dating for years before getting married. (Mitch's third-ever Instagram post back in 2013 was a cute pic of him and Tori, which Mitch captioned, "Me and the babe @tortorra_ on the set of Spun Out.")</p><p>A report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VimBuzz</a> states that Tori and Mitch started dating in 2010.</p><p>So, when did the couple actually get married? After a bit more investigative Instagram scrolling, we noticed that Mitch wrote this to Tori on her birthday on Dec. 29th, 2017: "18 more days until you're stuck with me forever." Tori and Mitch tied the knot in mid-January of 2018 in a Caribbean wedding ceremony.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Just a few months later, Tori took to her own Instagram to sing her new husband's praises. "Every day I learn more about you and every day I fall more in love," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote</a>. "You’re compassionate, generous, kind, tenacious and hot damn, do you make me laugh."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do Tori and Mitch have any children?</h2><p>At the moment, it looks like Tori and Mitch's only children are their respective acting careers. Tori had already built up quite the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> page before she joined the NCIS: Hawaiʻi cast, starring in projects like Blindspot, The Other Kingdom, Caught, and No Tomorrow.</p><p>Three cheers for the Canadian cuties, eh? Catch Tori when new episodes of NCIS: Hawaiʻi air every Monday at 10 p.m. ET on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwM6roGaZnpmys7%2FOp2SmmaKntqaw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cillian-murphy-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cillian Murphy - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
