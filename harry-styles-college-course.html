I think it‚Äôs so important for young people to see what is important to them reflected in their curriculum," Dr. Valencia continued.</p><p>If you're looking to enroll, it will be offered through the Honors College at Texas State.</p><p>"The classes are capped at 20, so we can have in-depth conversations," Dr. Valencia revealed to NBC News.
