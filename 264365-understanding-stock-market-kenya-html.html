Back then, the stock market was an informal marketplace for local shares and stocks.

During this time, stock trading was a side business done by lawyers, accountants, real estate agents and auctioneers who met and exchanged prices based on a gentleman's agreement.</p><p class=align-left>In 1951, Francis Drummond, an estate agent, established the first professional stock exchange firm. Francis approached Sir Ernest Vasey, the finance minister of Kenya back then who suggested the setting up a stock exchange market in East Africa. Later on, in July 1953, the two approached the London Stock Exchangeand the London officials accepted to recognize the setting up the NSE as an overseas stock exchange.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d5bff9ded1110af6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all Fintech companies in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1954, the NSE became officially recognized as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange.
