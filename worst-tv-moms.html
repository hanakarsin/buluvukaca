But when you take a look at all of the pretty terrible fictional moms on <a href=#>television</a>, you're bound to be able to appreciate what you have a little more. On <a href=#>Mother's Day</a>, and honestly every other day of the year, consider these worst <a href=#>TV moms</a> compared to yours.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Gemma Teller Morrow had her high points, but she was still awful.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FX</span></figure><p>In the early days of Sons of Anarchy, Gemma proved herself as a faithful mother and grandmother. But later, when she suspected her son's wife of being a rat, she went too far and murdered the woman in cold blood. Even before that, though, Gemma's actions were almost always motivated by some selfish needs rather than her son's well-being.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Selyse Baratheon supported her daughter's murder.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>On Game of Thrones, Selyse allowed Melisandre and Stannis to burn her daughter Shireen at the stake in support of the Red God and in order to give them what they wanted in terms of taking the iron throne. Selyse later died by suicide because of the ordeal. However, she also locked Shireen in a secluded room for most of her life, so she never really stood a chance at being a decent mother.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lucille Bluth wasn't supposed to be the best mother, TBH.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Arrested Development is a comedy and Lucille was never meant to be the picture of a perfect mother. But from admitting that she "doesn't care for Gob," her eldest son, to choosing herself over her adult children more often than not, she certainly takes the cake when it comes to awful TV moms. Even if that was the whole point of her character.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Victoria Davis took decades to become a decent mother.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><p>The first few seasons of One Tree Hill featured a motherless Brooke Davis. Later, her mother came into the picture but only because Brooke's fashion line and company could benefit her. Victoria continued to use her daughter and tried to push others out of Brooke's life in the cruelest ways possible. She eventually came around, but it took literal years.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cookie Lyon was never above manipulation with her kids.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>Cookie pitted her sons against each other on Empire and she was never afraid to use them to get to their father, her ex-husband. Most of her actions were motivated by wanting to take over the family recording company. And in doing so, she often had to use her sons in one way or another, even when it was detrimental to their mental or physical health.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Monica Gallagher abandoned her kids… more than once.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Showtime</span></figure><p>It should go without saying that Monica from Shameless is one of the very worst TV moms out there. The Showtime series followed the Gallagher children as they navigated the Southside of Chicago while living in poverty and squalor and Monica was one of the reasons for that. She left them more than once, used drugs when she was pregnant with at least one of her kids, and popped in and out of their lives with no regard for her children's feelings.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Vanetta Teagues was as bad as fans feared she'd be.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Before Janine's mom made her Season 2 debut on Abbott Elementary, viewers had only heard about how absentee she was and how Janine had strived to have a relationship with her for years. So when she showed up, full of empty promises and nothing of substance, viewers weren't exactly shocked.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, as long as you don't have a Vanetta Teagues, consider yourself lucky.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyzv9Nmq69lnaS6tA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./262926-butchery-business-kenya-earn-easy-money-kenya-by-selling-meat-html.html><span>←</span><span>Butchery Business in Kenya- Earn Easy Money in Kenya by Selling Meat</span></a>
