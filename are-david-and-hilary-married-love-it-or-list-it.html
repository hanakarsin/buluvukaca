They have both been married before, just not to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Hilary and David actually first met via Love It or List It, and thankfully for viewers, their banter seemed to come naturally.&nbsp;</p><p>Though some have speculated about David's sexual orientation online, he has been married to a woman named Krista Grycko-Visentin since 2006. The couple has a son and a daughter together.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite never appearing on her husband's popular series before, Krista is also involved in the real estate business. She works alongside her husband at Country Living Realty Ltd. She has been on David's team there since 2014.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Hilary Farr's partner?</h2><p>As for Hilary's marital status, she has been divorced from producer Gordon Farr for decades. The two got married in 1982, and they welcomed a son named Josh together before splitting. Through Josh, Hilary is a grandmother of three.&nbsp;</p><p>The TV designer has also been in a relationship for quite some time. She has referred to having a partner/boyfriend on her Instagram and Twitter accounts, but she has largely kept the details of his identity private.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>And Andrew found the horn! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gPRpIikp46</a></p>— Hilary Farr (@Hilary_Farr) <a href=#>April 10, 2020</a></figure><p>It does appear as if her boyfriend's name is Andrew Tatarek. The two have been photographed together at events since 2013. It's unclear when exactly the two first began dating, and other details about Andrew's life and career are publicly unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the love lives of the Love It or List It stars, David and Hilary are just work spouses.&nbsp;</p><p>Love It or List It airs on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on HGTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecOaraKcXZa7pXnHoqOaqqliuqK%2B0aKcnWWcpMOmecitZKiqXaG2tMCMoqs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-another-fake-news-fg-responds-to-lagos-judicial-panel-report.html><span>←</span><span>'Another Fake News' - FG Responds To Lagos Judicial Panel Report</span></a>
