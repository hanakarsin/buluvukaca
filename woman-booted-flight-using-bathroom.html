"He called a guard over to intimidate me but when I burst into tears the guard assessed rightly that WestJet dude was the a------."</p><p>Then, as Joanna tells it, the supervisor demanded she delete a video of the exchange, and said she would <a href=#>not be allowed to fly</a> the next day if she didn't comply.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We were in the baggage area and I started filming the exchange.

She was much nicer but refused to give me a booking reference for my rebooked flight. She told me to just come back to the airport tomorrow and ask at the counter."</p><p>Apparently, the fact that Joanna decided to share the embarrassing and disconcerting incident led to her finally getting the customer service assistance she desired from the very beginning.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It is sad that I wasn’t able to get any help unless I publicly aired my experience. WestJet DM’d me my booking reference number after I had asked for it repeatedly at the airport. I ended up getting in the taxi because I was legitimately worried about getting arrested.</p>— Joanna Chiu (@joannachiu) <a href=#>February 10, 2024</a></figure><p>Once the company saw her tweets, it appears they helped her get a booking reference number and she was able to get a flight home.</p><p>"Hi everyone. I’m home safe and sound!" Joanna updated her followers two days after her initial flight. She shared a concerning health update as well. "There continued to be an unfortunate series of events involving urgent care treatment, but I’m OK now!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My last word: Check whether your destination is known for stomach bugs.

So are we!</p><p>Well, WestJet had this to say in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>, “We sincerely apologize to Ms. Chiu for the inconvenience and discomfort she experienced during her recent travel experience. Ensuring the wellbeing and safety of our guests and crew is our number one priority and therefore we take any health-related concerns very seriously.”</p><p>“While unexpected illness can occur while traveling, maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all guests and crew members is paramount. In circumstances where a guest is deemed unfit to travel due to illness, our crew must make difficult decisions in the name of safety," the statement concluded.</p><p>Despite the unpleasant experience, we're glad the situation worked out for Joanna and that she made a full recovery!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mmainpJqxbrLLop6hrF2qwKq6xmaZmqyYp7ywuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./colleen-ballinger-baby-name.html><span>←</span><span>This Is Colleen Ballinger's Baby's Name, If Her Fans Are Correct</span></a>
