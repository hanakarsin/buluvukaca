It turned out to be a positive thing for Zola because&nbsp;Janicza fought for Zola‚Äôs involvement in the project even more, making sure the thread‚Äôs author got an Executive Producer credit along with her compensation.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Zola wasn‚Äôt on set for most of the filming because she was pregnant at the time, she said that Janicza would FaceTime her from the set to make sure they were getting the true authenticity of the story on film.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span><p>Director Janicza Bravo, AZiah King and Riley Keough</p></figure><p>The same went for actress Taylour Paige, who plays Zola in the movie. ‚ÄúTaylour and I got close, on a personal level,‚Äù Zola explained to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>. ‚Äú[S]he really wanted to do it justice.
