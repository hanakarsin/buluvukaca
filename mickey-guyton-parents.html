My dad going to work two hours earlier than everybody, just to solidify his space, and him working overtime to keep us in a private school, because the neighborhood we lived in, they didn't want black kids to go to that school," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a> of the inspiration of her song. "The bridge is where I wanted to address that I know I'm not the only one and that it's not about me — that there are brown lives that don't matter; LGBTQ lives that don't matter; transgendered black men that are getting murdered at an alarming rate; the white women being discriminated [against] in country music."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mickey Guyton's husband, Grant, also inspired her to change the direction of her music.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Along with current events and her own lived experiences influencing her songs, Mickey also revealed that <a href=#>her husband, Grant, </a>— whom she met in 2010, got engaged to in 2016, and married in 2017 — is her muse.</p><p>"That was part of working on myself: I had to step outside of myself and realize I'm getting older," she explained. "I can't sing about liking boys, because I have a man. And having to find a different perspective for a grown woman."</p><p>In fact, her newest song, "Somethin’ Bout You" was inspired by her hubby, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Mayhem Magazine,</a> "That man is my biggest fan and he loves the song. I wrote it about him. Really, it’s about just loving that person that just means so much to me."</p><p>The couple welcomed their first child together, <a href=#>a boy named Grayson,</a> in 2020 —&nbsp;just as Mickey was finding herself as an artist.</p><p>"What I saw in front of me was love,” she added. "I think the world needs so much of it right now. Especially right now. So that’s what I want to do is bring love and light."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforakt8SyZKCtqam8r3nPmqmepqSo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1108771-breaking-arewa-youths-move-issuing-90-day-quit-notice-igbos-north-html.html><span>←</span><span>BREAKING: Arewa youths make next move after issuing 90 day quit notice to Igbos in north</span></a>
