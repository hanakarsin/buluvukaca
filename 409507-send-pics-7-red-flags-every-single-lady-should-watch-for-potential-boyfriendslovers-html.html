They are stuck with partners who do less for them and are nothing but a burden.</p><p class=align-left>Ever been in love?

Asks for money</strong></p><p class=align-left>If a man asks you for money, once, twice, or ten times, run my sister! He will make it a habit of borrowing money from you and never refund. Let him work hard and get his own.</p><p class=align-left><strong>2. Calls you nonstop</strong></p><p class=align-left>This is a red flag you should never ignore. He is either insecure or very idle. Communication is key to a healthy relationship but overdoing it is a clear indication that it won't last. If he keeps calling every minute in the name of checking up on you, think twice before taking things to another level.</p><p class=align-left><strong>3. Keeps giving false promises</strong></p><p class=align-left>If your prince charming is a serial liar, that is a red flag you shouldn't ignore. If he keeps promising you good things but doesn't fulfil any of them, don't waste your time, dear, move on.</p><p class=align-left><strong>4. Is a mama's boy</strong></p><p class=align-left>Men attached to their mothers find it hard to trust other women. Also, such men will include their mothers in each decision they make, and you'll have no say in that relationship. His mother will control it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/63c42cc4ced9ad23.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ best bar jokes and one-liners that are so hilarious</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>5. I need a favour type of man</strong></p><p class=align-left>If his favours are all about you borrowing money from <a href=#>Fuliza</a> (mobile money app) for him, dump that man, dear sister. In the end, he will leave you in debts, and you'll struggle alone to repay. Never do anything to impress a man who can walk out of your life any time.</p><p class=align-left>If he has money <a href=#>loan apps</a> on his phones, run sister, he might be a serial loan defaulter, and if you end up with such a man, you will never be happy.</p><p class=align-left><strong>6. Spends the whole day at the gym instead of going to work</strong></p><p class=align-left>Fitness is part of a healthy lifestyle, but if your man is always at the gym drooling over women and not thinking of working so that you can build your future together, you're in trouble. He isn't the type of man you should waste your time with.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to tell you</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>7. Send me photos</strong></p><p class=align-left>If your man keeps asking you for photos, especially if you're in the same vicinity, he's idle. Why can't he visit you and see you face to face? If he asks for explicit pics every time you chat, that's a clear indication that he's after physical attention and not love. A man who respects you can't be begging for photos from you. What happens if they're leaked?</p><p class=align-left><strong>TUKO.co.ke </strong>also recently published a piece about Kenyan women complaining about Bukusu men, claiming they are <a id="https://www.tuko.co.ke/408144-bukusu-men-are-stingy-unromantic-kenyan-women-claim.html?fbclid=IwAR2WDya_v0Xs30k1JPt4UzpeXYv_wXnyu3R3RmRoQNJr5RBIbvPaGwCQ66M" href=#>stingy and unromantic</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Those who've dated Bukusu men shared their experiences, warning others not to dare fall in love with these men from Luhya land.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
