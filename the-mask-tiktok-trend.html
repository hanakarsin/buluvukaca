This movie is filled with hilarious moments and incredible sound opportunities, so it should come as no surprise that the latest trend happens to feature a bit from this film. Let us explain.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the Mask TikTok Trend?</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>The Mask trend features a clip from the film where Jim Carrey's jaw literally drops with his tongue rolling out, eyes popping out of their sockets, and his heart beating all the way out of his chest. This moment in the movie happens when The Mask is in a club and sees Tina Carlyle (played by the beautiful Cameron Diaz) for the very first time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In the trend, Cameron Diaz's moments are replaced by the TikTok creator filming themselves or inserting photos of themselves looking and feeling good, while a remix of "Players" by Coi Leray plays in the background.</p><p>TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@rhegan777</a> inserted a clip of herself dancing in a leather ensemble and knee-high boots, adding text that reads "y'all's girlfriends when they see me" at the top of the clip. Some of the viewers replied with comments such as "guilty", "FACTS", and "honestly... no lies detected."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@bellaryannnn</a> inserted a clip of herself singing the lyrics with the writing "your man when he sees me." But don't worry, she's not being serious. "Relax ladies, I’m just hopping on the trend," she wrote.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@marlon3lg</a> honestly was an immediate ick. He inserted a picture of himself shirtless and holding his junk while at the gym. Guess he's not as caught up on his TikTok trends as he thought, because a shirtless gym selfie is definitely not the <a href=#>female gaze</a>. And the people would have to agree:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Not everyone is feeling this trend though. User <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@looksbyhala</a> wrote, "This green mask trend feels like the Facebookification of TikTok," with a caption that reads, "It feels so millennial idk." (We mean, you're not wrong.)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, our favorite version of the trend that we've seen is this one right here. The video by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@docdami</a> has the writing, "Girls after they see my client's haircut" with a before photo of a bowl haircut, followed by a really fresh-looking 'do. That haircut truly is fire.</p><p>Personally, we would probably make one that said "Us when we see pizza" with some thirst traps of cheese being melty and all that. Talk about a jaw-drop, tongue-roll-out moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecyaqqRlpJ64tbvKZqurnZ6Z</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./57159-html.html><span>←</span><span>Unrest in Port Harcourt as ex-militants plot against Amaechi.</span></a>
