On social media, however, many came to her defense, while others called out Alinity for her repeated offenses.&nbsp;</p><p>(We made the decision to not share the video of the wardrobe malfunction on this website to respect Alinity's privacy). &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitch</span></figure><p>"OK what? Tthis Alinity b---h can abuse her cat, moon the steam and now flash her titties with no repercussions but actually amazing artists have even an outline of a boob and they get banned? explain that to me," one Twitch user tweeted.

I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten frustrated with Milo, but I dropped him on the floor behind my chair.‚Äù Adding, ‚ÄúI'm not that strong.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>She went on to respond to fellow Twitch users who wanted to report her to animal protection services. "I also understand the desire to report me to pet authorities and encourage anyone to do so if they feel pets are being mistreated, by anyone, anywhere," she tried to explain. "My animals are well loved, and live in a warm and caring home, and I will comply with any authority that seeks to validate this."&nbsp;</p><p>Alinity continued, ‚ÄúI think a lot of people are doing this because they believe they are doing the right thing, so no salt.
