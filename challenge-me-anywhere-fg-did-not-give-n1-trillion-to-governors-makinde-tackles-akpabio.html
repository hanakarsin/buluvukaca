I know when things happen. And if we want to play politics, we will keep quiet and say, let it slide, but we are not going to let this slide.</p><p>“First, the FIRS cannot give any money to any state; it is not possible. All revenues accruing to our country go into the federation account, and the money is distributed to all the tiers of government. The Federal Government does not give money to the state; the money in the federation account belongs to all of us, and it is not only to the Federal Government.</p><p>“We need to engage with our people; if our policies are not working, we need to listen to them and amend them. If the number three citizen says this is an unverified report, why does he need to say it? Does that give confidence to our people, or does it solve the problem of hunger and anger in our land?’</p><p>“Let me say it clearly: for Oyo State and my colleagues, there is nothing like N30bn being given for food security to the states, and I stand to be challenged.’’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FsZpygkaG5prrGnmSmnV2Wu7rDx56pnmWWnHqltcNmpaisXZy2t7GMp2hmrKKeua21zqdkraddnLy3sdGnpqurXaKurLXNnZxmrJGYuK2x0maYpKiRl7awew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./250172-bazokizo-collo-shows-tall-wife-kenyans-reactions-epic-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bazokizo Collo shows off his tall wife and Kenyans reactions are epic</span></a>
