They have daughters named Ava, Lucy and Caroline, and a son named Charles.</p><h2>Associated With</h2><p>His unlikely completion to <a href=#>David Tyree</a>, which became known as the "Helmet Catch," late in Super Bowl XLII helped propel the Giants to a 17-14 win and spoiled the Patriots' hopes of an undefeated season.&nbsp;</p><h2>Video</h2><a class=video-thumbnail href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.famousbirthdays.com/v/images/640/eli-manning-clips_19953.jpg alt="Eli Manning Highlights" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Eli Manning Highlights</p></a><a id=btn-edit href=# class="to-edit btn-edit" data-url=eli-manning.html title="Send Suggestion"></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OzornOrqqboaKptaWt2KxlnKedZL2mu8%2BlnGidnJ56rq3Np6Cnn16dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./412162-bank-manager-in-tears-losing-toyota-prad-vehicle-in-machakos-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bank Manager In Tears after Losing Toyota Prado Vehicle In Machakos</span></a>
