The duo were also conspicuously absent.</p><p>Wike, while speaking accused Ayu of collecting N1 bribe, another N100 million and billions of naira raised from the sale of forms but refused to defend himself.</p><p>He challenged Ayu to sue him, repeatedly saying, “Ayu, you are corrupt, you cannot lead us to a campaign. You cannot lead Rivers people to the campaign.”</p><p>While stopping to apologize personally to the Benue State governor, whom he said was not informed of his latest revelation, Wike added that “Rivers State people are angry.</p><p>He said, “I went to Benue State. Ayu you have not stayed one year in office and you are courting corruption.</p><p>“Ayu sue me.
