"Voice and text services are now restored. Thank you for your patience as we fixed the issues. We sincerely apologize for any and all inconveniences," he wrote at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>However, rumors of a widespread DDoS attack had already surfaced.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, that was proven to be false, thanks to Cloudflare's Matthew Prince. "There‚Äôs a lot of buzz right now about a ‚Äúmassive DDoS attack‚Äù targeting the U.S., complete with scary-looking graphs," he tweeted along with said scary graphs.

A common cause can be that your phone's firmware or software is not up to date.&nbsp;</p><p>So, go to the Software Update option on your phone (while connected to wireless) and wait for your phone to update and reboot.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If that doesn't work, and you have a Samsung Galaxy phone, it could be an issue with your SIM card. Make sure it is placed in the phone correctly. If not, try using a different card to see if that helps.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also try going to the Settings of your phone, then Wireless & Networks > Mobile Networks > Network Operators > Select your own network.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about when your phone says "Emergency Calls Only?"</h2><p>Again, this is most likely associated with a carrier outage like T-Mobile experienced, but if that is not the case, there a few things you can do. Check your SIM card, make sure your bill is paid, and try a simple restart on your phone.&nbsp;</p><p>If that does not work, a factory reset may be required, but that should be your last resort.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This will wipe all data from the memory of the phone, so make sure you have everything backed up before you choose this option.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does my phone go to 4G when I make a call?</h2><p>Another common issue T-Mobile users had during the "outage" was their phone switching to 4G.&nbsp;</p><p>"Anyone with T-Mobile having issues with the signal?? My phone keeps going from LTE to 4g to nothing at all and I can‚Äôt make any phone calls," one person complained on Twitter, before another added, "It shows as having between three and four bars of LTE coverage, then I make a call coverage switches immediately to 4G and the call dropped."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Time might be your best friend when it comes to this issue, and just waiting for the network to be restored. However, there are a few things you can try<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> if your LTE is not working</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be as simple as turning Airplane Mode on and off ‚Äî or, making sure the correct network mode is enabled.
