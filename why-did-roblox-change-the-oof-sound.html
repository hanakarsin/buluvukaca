The "To Be Continued" meme often accompanied by "Roundabout" from iconic progressive rock band Yes was so popular that people didn't even know it came from the anime series <a href=#>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</a>. Many of the old templates seen on sites like Memebase are actually re-edited pictures of celebrity reaction images.</p><p>In later years, <a href=#>Roblox</a> became a source of similar memes.</p><p>The popular online gaming platform has given rise to several new memes throughout its lifespan, including new slang like "<a href=#>skibidi</a>" and "<a href=#>Fanum tax</a>." However, one of the most iconic memes that Roblox has ever spawned has got to be the "oof" sound. It's a simple exclamation of pain that sounds like it's coming from a child, but it's made its rounds as an expression of both physical or emotional damage. But why did Roblox eventually change the "oof" sound?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: X/@Roblox</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why did Roblox change the "oof" sound? It was replaced back in 2022.</h2><p>Alternatively known as the "Roblox Death Sound" or its official in-game label as "Uuhhh," the Roblox oof sound was first introduced to the platform when Roblox launched its beta back in 2005. It remained as part of Roblox's many optional sound effects for its in-game characters, but it eventually grew to be used outside of Roblox. The sound was often used in other internet memes in response to humorous instances of bodily harm or even the damaging of one's online reputation.</p><p>It came to signify damage in every sense of the word, whether someone was involved in an outlandish accident or meme videos detailing the downfall of a particular influencer. However, its use in Roblox became a point of contention after more than a decade since its inclusion in the game.</p><p>Though it was first implemented in Roblox in 2005, the sound effect was actually created back in 1999.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reportedly</a>, the "oof" sound was created by longtime video game music composer Tommy Tallarico. In fact, it was created for a PC game called Messiah, which was released in the year 2000. He also claimed to have co-created the effect with sound designer Joey Kuras.</p><p>Due to its ever-increasing usage in both Roblox and across the internet, Tommy ended up suing Roblox for its usage in 2019.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Related to sounds, due to a licensing issue we have removed the “oof” sound from Roblox and have created a replacement default sound which launches today.<br>We plan to expand our Avatar Shop with a whole range of both old and new sounds in the future. More to come on this.</p>— Roblox (@Roblox) <a href=#>July 26, 2022</a></figure><p>Initially, the two parties had reached an agreement in 2020, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>. It was first ruled that anyone using the sound in Roblox would have to pay a $1 fee to use the sound in their own game creations on the platform. In 2022, however, it was removed entirely.</p><p>According to an official statement from Roblox on X (formerly Twitter), its removal was part of its internal movement to obtain sounds and effects directly from creators. The statement also cites a "licensing issue" with the sound.</p><p>It was immediately replaced by another sound effect of a similar pained expression, though it lacks the same kind of impact that the old one had with its decade-plus-long meme status.</p><p>Big "oof" on that one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aqn5e5sMSMnJ%2BappeaerW0xGamqJ5dqLy2usM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-bam-margera-in-new-jackass-movie.html><span>←</span><span>Skateboarder and Series Regular Bam Margera May Appear in 'Jackass Forever' After All</span></a>
