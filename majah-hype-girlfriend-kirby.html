The picture shows her with an injured eye after she was allegedly beaten and abused by the popular social media influencer and comedian.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Latisha Kirby came forward with abuse allegations against Majah on Instagram.</h2><p>During a #WomanWednesday Instagram chat with her fans, Latisha said, "I wanna apologize to my mother, my son, my sister, to my niece, to my friends. I detached myself from the people that loved me the most for a long time. I owe you guys the biggest apology.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>"What I've been going through, the average person doesn't go through that in a whole lifetime. I've been keeping it a secret for a long time. Hiding abuse is a full-time job. You have to detach yourself from your loved ones so they don't know. I did that for a long time," she continued.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Latisha talked about the pain of icing out family and friends to hide the abuse.</h2><p>On Instagram, Latisha dove into what it had been like to be in an abusive relationship — including purposefully icing out family and friends in order to hide her alleged abuse and protect her abuser.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Imagine having to hide your bruises and you're being battered from your family, imagine after being abused and assaulted, you have to console the person that hurt you because now they're distraught," she explained.</p><p>Latisha continued, "They want to harm themselves. So now you don't have the chance to heal, you don't have the chance to be upset... imagine after going through all those things, you still have to have sex, you're still expected to be delightful like there's nothing wrong with you when your face is unrecognizable…"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While some people accused Latisha of being unfaithful or causing the abuse, she assured fans that the abuse was inexcusable and unprovoked.
