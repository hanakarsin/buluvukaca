For years, we've all suspected that there was enough room for Jack on that door had Rose simply scooted over and helped him up. In fact, we were so sure of it that the Mythbusters tested the theory out themselves to see if Jack could have truly shared weight on that floating door."><meta name=author content="Almeda Bohannan"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Get your pitchforks ready.</p><p>In an interview with The Advertiser, the 10th graders explained that they could've both made it had they climbed onto the door together and stuck their life jackets underneath to give it more buoyancy.. &nbsp;15-year-old Abigail explained:</p>&nbsp;"We looked at how buoyant the door would have been, and how that would have changed if there were people on top of that. There was a lot of exploring and testing, and we had to fiddle with different buoyancies and look at what materials were realistic for that time."&nbsp;<p>The group won the National Maths Talent Quest with their airtight submission. It's no surprise considering that the movie came out two decades ago and people are still arguing that there was a chance Jack could've been saved. It's some awesome mathematical work.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can't let go of me belief that there was enough space on the door for both Jack and Rose at the end of Titanic.üòì<a href=#>#ThingsICantLetGo</a></p>‚Äî Steven (@BoiTokio) <a href=#>July 4, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Titanic, one of the sweetest love stories... until the end when Rose & her fat arse decided there was no space for Jack on the floating door <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7lBqIRF4WR</a></p>‚Äî Jaye (@JayePee_) <a href=#>August 29, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm still not over the fact that Rose could have made some space for Jack</p>‚Äî karen (@behlieve) <a href=#>July 26, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>There was enough space on the door frame for Rose AND Jack <a href=#>https://t.co/UkAtouMmH2</a></p>‚Äî Lorns (@LornaRobinson_) <a href=#>June 29, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>unpopular opinion: there wasn't enough space for both Rose and Jack</p>‚Äî spoopy josie (@josiebedford4) <a href=#>June 19, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>THERE WAS PLENTY OF SPACE ON THAT DOOR FOR BOTH JACK AND ROSE ALSO WHO THROWS AWAY A PERFECTLY GOOD DIAMOND NECKLACE <a href=#>#ThursdayThoughts</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4PWNbmfyrz</a></p>‚Äî Philip Ellis (@Philip_Ellis) <a href=#>October 5, 2017</a></figure><p>In Rose's defense, you're probably not going to be all that analytical when you're soaked and half-dead to begin with.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think?
