But I do know that sometimes it's not that easy. There are days when reading those comments can really pile [up]. It almost makes it more of something that you're insecure about. So it's hard sometimes when you do get down and read it."</p><p>Instead, Addison told the outlet that she tries to remain positive. "I just tell myself that if someone is being negative, it could be because they feel negative and they want to release that tension so they put it onto someone else," she added.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Addison Rae was previously criticized for her weight by internet trolls.</h2><p>In April, Addison addressed social media users who <a href=#>criticized the young star about her weight</a>. However, the starlet decided to use the negativity to her advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've seen 5-10 tweets & TikToks today talking negatively about my body and weight ... it makes me feel insecure, but luckily I'm looking at it in a different light," she tweeted on April 21. "I've been very motivated to start eating better and working out everyday to become the healthiest version of myself!"</p><p>Addison continued in a follow-up tweet: "It definitely hurts to see people on my [For You Page] calling me 'a whale' and saying 'she's fat now' and I just want to encourage everyone who hears these things about themselves to love yourself! If you are healthy and happy, do NOT listen to these hurtful comments. You are perfect."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aZlJm2tLvNZqmanV2pwrO6jKidn2WTpLqusc2tqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1127283-what-business-education-it-html.html><span>←</span><span>What is business education and why do you need it?
