The involvement of different athletic commissions, and getting MMA contests legalized in different states was an uphill battle.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>To put it into perspective: the sport didn't become legal in New York until 2016. Jon Jones, who was originally from Rochester, NY, won his title against Shogun in Newark, NJ.</p><p>He entered the cage coming out to Alicia Keys' and Jay-Z's "New York" track, a nod to being in proximity of the city all pugilists wanted to scrap in: Manhattan's Madison Square Garden. Now, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, however, it's difficult to get fights sanctioned in any state. The litany of bans and self-isolation orders will likely vary from state to state after the federal recommendation for non-essential employees to stay home until April 30 is over, too.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Which means that the future of events the UFC puts on are in jeopardy. Well, they would be if you weren't someone like Dana White, who is demonstrating a relentless creativity in his pursuit of putting on fights. Many fight fans thought that UFC 249 was going to be pushed to a later date thanks to Khabib Nurmagomedov's inability to participate in the contest thanks to Russian travel sanctions. But the UFC dipped into an old MMA playbook to get the fight card booked.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tachi Palace Casino is back, baby.</h2><p>Located in Lemoore, Calif. on a Native American reservation, the Tachi Palace Casino isn't beholden to the California State Athletic commission, and has their own ruling body for sporting events in place. If you watched a lot of WEC events back in the day, then you're no stranger to the venue that's seen its fair share of epic MMA bouts. We'll now be able to add the bout between Tony Ferguson and Khabib's replacement, Justin Gaethje, to that list.</p><p>Booking the card at Tachi brings up a slew of other interesting questions: will USADA testing be employed for the fighters, or will it be the wild west of MMA where everyone was clearly juiced to the gills and able to bypass the joke of a PED exam with relative ease? What about international fights and fight cards though? It might be difficult to get everyone to California, which has strict self-isolation guidelines in place for its citizens.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>This sounds like a horrible movie plot.⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ #danawhite #ufc #ufcnews #mma #mmanews #mixedmartialarts #coronavirus #covid19 #mmacovid #sbnation #mmamania</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>MMAmania.com</a> (@mmamaniadotcom) on Apr 8, 2020 at 4:51am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's the location of UFC's private fight island?</h2><p>While the Tachi palace has its advantages (especially for legal grey areas) for being located on a Native American reservation, at least it's in a known location.
