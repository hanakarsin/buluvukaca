On May 13, following the news that he filed for divorce, many wanted to learn more about Rory's personal life, including his marriage.</p><p>While Rory has not released any sort of public statement about his divorce, there are some things we do know about his relationship with Erica Stoll. The two were married for seven years, and now their relationship has come to an end.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who was Rory McIlroy married to?</h2><p>Rory was married to Erica Stoll for seven years. The two first got married in April of 2017 at Ashford Castle in County Mayo, Ireland. Erica has been supportive of Rory throughout their marriage, and even caddied for him in 2023 at the Masters Par 3 Contest.</p><p>Erica is a former employee of the PGA of America, and the two first met in 2012 at the Ryder Cup when she was working as a transport official.</p><p>When Rory overslept because of a time zone mixup, Erica got him a police escort to make sure that he wouldn't be late for the tournament. The two didn't become romantically involved until 2014, though, because Rory was dating tennis player Caroline Wozniacki at the time.</p><p>"It's still cool to look around and think about that week, and obviously everything that's happened since then. It's pretty cool," Rory told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golf Channel.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Rory and Erica are now getting a divorce.</h2><p>After seven years together, the news broke that Rory had filed for divorce from Erica. In an official statement released by Rory's team, they asked for privacy.</p><p>“Rory McIlroy’s communications team confirmed today that a divorce has been filed," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the statement said</a>. "They stressed Rory’s desire to ensure this difficult time is as respectful and amicable as possible."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by RORY (@rorymcilroy)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@rorymcilroy</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Does Rory McIlroy have any kids?</h2><p>Rory and Erica shared one child together: Poppy, who is 3 years old. Rory tends to spend most of his time focused on his professional responsibilities, but when he has discussed his marriage and his daughter, it seems like he was genuinely happy.</p><p>Now, though, some are looking for evidence of cracks in his relationship with Erica, whether they were really there or not.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why did Rory McIlroy file for divorce?</h2><p>We don't have any explanation from Rory as to why he filed for divorce. It's possible that he may release some sort of explanation at some point, but it seems more likely that he wants to conduct the divorce as quietly and amicably as possible. Airing grievances may not be the best way to achieve that goal.</p><p>In 2015, he seemed thrilled by their still new romance.</p><p>"I am very happy in my love life. We haven't really been putting it out there. She is from America, which is why I like to spend time in Palm Beach … The past six or seven months have been really nice. That part of my life is going great," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said at the time</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7yzxYymmqKkoqTGbrnAq6minZQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wassce-government-begs-npower-teachers-to-resume.html><span>←</span><span>Government Begs Npower Teachers To Resume</span></a>
