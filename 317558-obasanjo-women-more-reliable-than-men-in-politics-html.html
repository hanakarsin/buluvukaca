When a woman says she’s with you, you can really take that she is with you.</p><p>“But if a man tells you he is with you and you catch him in another meeting, he will tell you it is politics. It should not be so.</p><p>“When a politician’s words cannot be believed, then you are turning politics into another thing. A politician must be a man or woman of honour, that believes in morality,” Obasanjo said.</p><p>Also speaking at the event, the National President of NAWOJ, Mrs Ifeyinwa Omowole, said the visit was in recognition of Obasanjo’s belief in the unity of Nigeria.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHKDlG5vZqeSlsCiusmoZLCnnZq7brnOq5xmqpWhtqKuy55kraCRo3qusc1moKdloKS5qsDInKpnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./307310-makueni-brothers-kill-man-alleged-mothers-lover-html.html><span>←</span><span>Makueni: Brothers kill man alleged to be their mother's lover</span></a>
