I used to hate watching The Flintstones when I was a kid, basically because it was a cartoon version of The Honeymooners, and laugh tracks in a cartoon just seemed unnatural.
But that doesn't mean I wouldn't leave the TV on in the background while I was playing with my action figures. As a result, I became well acquainted with the show's world and its characters."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
