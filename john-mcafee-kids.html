However, John was found dead in a Spanish jail cell on June 23, 2021, while he was awaiting extradition to the U.S. for tax-related criminal charges.</p><p>Beyond the headlines, who was he as an individual, and what is his family like? Here are the known details, including some pretty unique facts about his kids that you may surprise you.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who are John McAfee's kids? He has made some wild claims about his private life.</h2><p>According to the mogul, he actually has 47 children but, as he once the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sun</a> in 2019: "It’s very difficult to keep track of. Almost all of them were illegitimate."</p><p>Nonetheless, John defended his good standing as a father, telling the Sun, "I keep in touch with everyone … I take care of all of them financially."</p><p>In a January 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> thread, John gave some insight into his relationship with his rather extensive immediate family.</p><p>John indicated that the number 47 may not be exact, and he wasn't totally sure of the extent of his family.</p><p>He appeared to slam some of his descendents as well, calling them "lazy."</p><p>He wrote: "I’m not here to give you solutions; for anything. That’s for you young folks of mine to do: My lazy children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Yes. I have great-grandchildren. I’m here to point to the reality around you. Which you children are so fond of ignoring. … Since you asked: I have 47 children. 61 grandchildren. 19 great-grandchildren. I have met none of my great-grandchildren," he wrote in the thread, evoking some pretty shocked reactions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">John admitted that due to a lack of DNA testing, his exact number of kids remains unknown.</h2><p>Continuing to break it down for followers, John said on Twitter: "These numbers might have been much smaller, had DNA testing been around while I was growing up. No interest at this point. To me, legacy has nothing to do with blood, and everything to do with the understanding that every child who crosses your path, is your child."</p><p>John gave even further insight in the replies to the thread, where he said 41 different women were mothers to his children, and that two of his kids actually relocated to Australia.</p><p>John also has three stepchildren: His wife, Janice McAfee, came into their marriage with three kids of her own. The pair were married in 2015 after three years of dating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ypuoymmpqelZp6rLXDrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./great-british-baking-show-disasters.html><span>←</span><span>The Most Disastrous Creations Made on The Great British Baking Show</span></a>
