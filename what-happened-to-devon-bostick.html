He spent four seasons on the show as Jasper Jordan, Monty's best friend who became disillusioned after going through several difficult experiences.</p><p>Jasper's storyline included depression and alcoholism, and the character ultimately took his own life in Season 4, Episode 11, "The Other Side." His passing was widely considered one of The 100's saddest moments.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Devon also shocked several of his fans by posting an Instagram video on Nov. 26, 2023 showing himself eating while sporting some facial injuries.
