Source: facebookDepression can be so crippling for some people that performing daily tasks seems impossible or simply not worth it.
For this 16-year-old who came into hairdresser Kayley Olsson's workplace, her depression made her not even want to comb her own hair.
Which left it looking like this.
Olsson shared the unnamed girl's story on Facebook, who said that the girl confessed she would only leave her bed to go to the bathroom."><meta name=author content="Almeda Bohannan"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She wrote about the entire experience in her touching Facebook post that showed the drastic before and after photos of the girl's hair.</p>Today I had one of the hardest experiences with my client who I am keeping anonymous, I had a 16 year girl come in with who has been dealing with severe depression for a few years now. She got to the point where she felt so down and so worthless she couldn't even brush her hair, she told me she only got up to use the restroom. She starts back at school in a few weeks but she has her school pictures today. When she walked in she told us just cut it all off I can't deal with the pain of combing it out, she called herself worthless for it. It honestly broke my heart and we tried everything we could to keep this child's hair for her! At the end of the day I want this to be a lesson to people. MENTAL HEALTH is a thing, it effects people all around the world and of all ages! PARENTS take it serious don't just push your kids off and tell them to get over something they legitimately can't. A CHILD should NEVER feel so worthless to not even want to brush their hair.After being here 8 hours yesterday and 5 hours today we finally made this beautiful girl smile and feel like she IS worth something! Her last words to me was"I will actually smile for my schools pictures today, you made me feel like me again" ❤️❤️&nbsp;<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>People were floored by Olsson's willingness to go above and beyond for her new client.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Olsson said that when the young girl saw her hair when it was done, she was overcome with emotion.</p>"I&nbsp;will actually smile for my schools pictures today, you made me feel like me again."<p>So awesome.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYSOamhokmGiuZLE0GifmqGiYrGmvNGeqqyhn6N6o7HFqKmeZZGbwaa%2B</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rajon-rondo-girlfriend-2020.html><span>←</span><span>NBA Star and Partner Sued for $1 Million</span></a>
