From walking alone to running errands, many women prefer to err on the side of caution by completing tasks in broad daylight."><meta name=author content="Enda Jantzen"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

However, one <a href=#>Uber Eats driver</a> decided to capitalize on male privilege by disguising herself as a man while dropping off food at night.</p><p>On <a href=#>TikTok</a>, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@tiazakher</a> (Tia Zakher) shared a hilarious (and mildly depressing) video of her attire to drop off deliveries in the dark. And naturally, the internet had some thoughts.</p><p>Here’s what happened.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@tiazakher</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">An Uber Eats driver disguised herself as a man to make night deliveries.</h2><p>In her viral <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, Tia explained that she makes more money delivering food at night and wanted to take additional measures to ensure her safety while doing so.</p><p>So, of course, her mind immediately went to dressing up in men’s clothing and altering her appearance to look more masculine.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tiazakher href=#>@tiazakher</a><p>male privilege 🙌🙌🙌</p><a title="♬ meaty get on your zoom - Real Queenzzielocthevoice" href=#>♬ meaty get on your zoom - Real Queenzzielocthevoice</a></figure><p>“POV: You’re scared to deliver orders at night alone, but you make more money at night, so you dress up as a man,” she wrote at the beginning of her TikTok. The creator then revealed her outfit: a gray hoodie, oversized jacket, khaki pants, and white sneakers.</p><p>Not only that, but she also showed herself wearing a baseball cap with a hood over it and a mask to hide the bottom half of her face. “Male privilege,” Tia wrote in her caption, alongside several raising hands emojis.</p><p>Despite this being an inventive way to protect herself from harm in the dark, TikTokers couldn’t help but offer their two cents on how she could further sell the role.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In the comments section, TikTok users offered the delivery driver advice on how to look even manlier.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@tiazakher</span></figure><p>While Tia’s ensemble proved convincing, creators advised her on potential improvements. The common consensus seemed to be that she needed baggier pants, while others told her not to cuff the trousers.</p><p>“Baggier pants and strong men's perfume, and you’re good to go,” one user quipped.</p><p>Another one added, “Try pants that aren’t cuffed at the bottom. I think that will help sell it.”</p><p>Tia was more than happy to accept everyone’s suggestions, promptly responding to several comments with gratitude. However, there was still an unfortunate underlying fact that many pointed out.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Women expressed disappointment with the reality of the delivery driver's situation.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@tiazakher</span></figure><p>Although Tia’s video invoked playful comments and tips in the comment section, some expressed anger and sadness over her need to go to such lengths to feel safe. “It’s so sad that we have to go through this as women,” a user noted.</p><p>Others mentioned they take a similar approach when completing different tasks at night. “Me walking to get groceries at night,” someone else wrote in the comment section.</p><p>And Tia couldn’t have agreed more. “Literally,” she responded.</p><p>“I worry so much when I see women delivery drivers or Uber [drivers],” a concerned commenter noted. “Always tip extra. Stay safe.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqq%2BmvoyemK2rXZm%2FqsLEq2SdoaOcwqq%2FxJ1kmqtdoq6v</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pentaverate-meaning.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning of The Pentaverate, Explained (EXCLUSIVE)</span></a>
