We promised that we would hit the ground running once we assume office. We gave our words that we would put you first and run a people-centred government. We pledged to uphold the best ideals befitting of an Omoluabi.</p><p>“As we draw the curtain on this first tenure, We are convinced that we neither reneged on our promises nor disappointed you. We kept faith in you and maintained fidelity to our electoral promises. It was our wish to continue to serve you but we are constrained by the outcome of the July 16 Governorship election which we are already challenging in court.</p><p>“As law-abiding citizens and government, we are stepping aside to allow the law to take its course.</p><p>“However, we look forward to continuing to serve you in no distant future. We have absolute trust in God that we shall be back soon, as we have implicit trust and confidence in the judiciary to do justice in the case before it.</p><p>“We are confident that this period of temporary political eclipse shall pass. The sun shall shine again, brighter and warmer and the sustainable development and participatory governance that we enthroned, which have been applauded by local and international organisations, shall be restored and put on a surer and better footing.</p><p>“There can be no substitute for people-oriented and development-savvy governance in a democracy. The tap roots of the unprecedented good governance, inclusive and participatory governance that we introduced, which delivered massive equitable projects and programmes are too strong to be uprooted.</p><p>“My Dear Good People of Osun, I cannot thank you enough for not only supporting us throughout our tenure but for also standing by us even after the outcome of the July 16 election. Your goodwill encouraged us to continue with all our projects till the last day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FwZqirpaN6sMXEraalmV2axbG%2BxKyqnqtdnbyxsYyonWaqlanCs7rIp55moZ5itaK6w6itnqpdo7y1sYyfrKWkXajBosDEppynrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./420670-marie-osmond-children-how-biological-kids-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marie Osmond children: How many biological kids does she have?</span></a>
