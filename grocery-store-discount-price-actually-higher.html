Eggs are the most expensive they’ve ever been, meat prices have increased by 10 percent, fruits and vegetables by 9 percent, and baked goods have climbed in price by 13 percent, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).</a></p><p>As such, folks are making it a point to take advantage of deals and sales at neighborhood supermarkets and popular chains. However, is a deal a deal when prices are sometimes marked up without our knowing? It seems that this is the case at one Woolies (aka Woolworths) location. A woman on <a href=#>TikTok</a> said that the grocery store discount price was actually higher than the original. Here’s the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Stock photo</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman claims that the grocery store discount price is actually higher than the original.</h2><p>The jig is up. In a September 2023 TikTok post, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mumma Kafe (@mummakafe)</a> shared a video of her latest find at a Woolies location, seemingly in Australia. And unfortunately, it looks like the store tried to pull a fast one on shoppers.</p><p>As the video starts, the TikToker is seen checking out the baked goods aisle and is eyeing a jelly-and-cream-filled donut for purchase. At first glance, the pastries are priced at $4.50 as a special. The sticker reads that customers will save $0.25 and says that the price of the six-pack was originally $4.75.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@mummakafe href=#>@mummakafe</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Mumma Kafe" href=#>♬ original sound - Mumma Kafe</a></figure><p>However, the grocery store clearly didn’t expect the woman to further investigate. She proceeded to rip off the special sticker price to see the original price. And she realized that not only was she played by the special price, the original price was $4.25.</p><p>After seeing the original price of the pastries, the TikToker proceeded to back away from the dessert aisle. So it’s safe to assume that she decided not to purchase the donuts.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@mummakafe</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok users are not surprised by the pricing and shared that there are ways around it.</h2><p>No one likes to feel ripped off, especially when it comes to purchasing food. So, once fellow TikTok users realized the situation at hand, many offered advice in the comment section.</p><p>“Don’t rip the special tickets off. If it's higher than the normal price, you get it for free when it's scanned. Company policy,” one person shared.</p><p>“By law, if there are two prices on display, they have to sell it for the lower one,” another person said.</p><p>Some folks revealed that they’ve had varying experiences at their neighborhood grocery store. A few people shared that some Woolies locations have digital price tags, so there’s no way to check the original price.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@mummakafe</a></figure><p>“They are changing prices more often so we can’t keep track of the price hikes. Every time I shop, things are at a different price compared to the week before,” another user shared.</p><p>With that in mind, it’s time that we all pay extra attention to the prices of our groceries. And should you have a similar issue, it may be best to speak with management. After all, every dollar counts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2Bwr8SrsGarpKS%2FpnnDoqqcp6WjwW680aKanmWRmMG2rculsGagmZy1pr4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./challenge-me-anywhere-fg-did-not-give-n1-trillion-to-governors-makinde-tackles-akpabio.html><span>←</span><span>Challenge Me Anywhere, FG Did Not Give N1 Trillion To Governors</span></a>
