Their announcement, captured in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">heartwarming Instagram post</a>, depicted the couple embracing in front of a sign adorned with a sonogram and the phrase, "Baby Coming Nov. 2023."</p><p>Their daughter, Leighton Drew Bolden, was born on Friday, Nov. 3, 2023, weighing 5 lbs., 9 oz. They took to Instagram on November 6 to express their boundless love for their newborn, sharing, "We couldn't be more in love with you!!!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Elizabeth Johnston (@lizzzjohnston)</a></p></figure><p>Since the arrival of their baby girl, Liz and Brice have continued to spend plenty of time together. However, it remains unclear whether they have rekindled their romance or are focused solely on co-parenting.</p><p>The two marked Leighton's first Thanksgiving and Christmas with the Johnston family, and Brice even extended warm birthday wishes to Elizabeth in December 2023. Regardless of their relationship status, it's heartening to witness their amicable connection.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Elizabeth's parents were worried about her giving birth with Achondroplasia.</h2><p>Although Elizabeth's pregnancy progressed without complications, her parents, Trent and Amber, couldn't shake their concerns about the hurdles posed by her high-risk pregnancy due to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">achondroplasia</a>, aka the most common form of dwarfism.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in March 2024, the fan-favorite pair discussed their fears and the complexities associated with childbirth for women with this condition. Amber told the outlet that Elizabeth needed to "have a C-section under general anesthesia."</p><p>Amber added, "So, therefore, she's put to sleep completely, which is really, really challenging when it comes to getting a baby out fast. Our pelvis is too narrow and, in a sense, kind of fused."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Elizabeth Johnston (@lizzzjohnston)</a></p></figure><p>Now that Leighton has entered the world, Amber and Trent expressed joy in seeing Elizabeth embrace her new role as a mother. Amber highlighted their strengthened bond, telling the outlet, "I feel like she and I have become even closer now that she's a mom."</p><p>Looking back on the wisdom of parenthood that becomes apparent once children become parents themselves, Trent humorously remarked, "We've been telling you this for 22 years. Y'all don't get it until you have your own child!"</p><p>He praised Elizabeth's nurturing nature, saying, "But it is amazing to watch your kids become parents. And Elizabeth is a nurse, and she already has a huge tender love and caring bone in her body, and that helps to be a mom, too."</p><p>Catch new episodes of 7 Little Johnstons on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmqxsCbnK2gXZ%2B8qbrSraanZZKWr7o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1238124-april-love-geary-bio-age-parents-ethnicity-relationship-robin-thicke-html.html><span>←</span><span>April Love Geary bio: age, parents, ethnicity, relationship with Robin Thicke</span></a>
