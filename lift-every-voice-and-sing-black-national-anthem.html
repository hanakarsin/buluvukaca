Initially, James wrote the song as a poem amid segregation, lynching, and other anti-Black attacks.</p><p>“Lift every voice and sing, ’til earth and heaven ring, ring with the harmonies of Liberty,” the lyrics begin, continuing with, “Let our rejoicing rise, high as the listening skies, let it resound loud as the rolling sea.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>James’s poem was later developed into a song by his brother, Rosamond. The brothers brought together a choir of 500 children to perform it at the segregated school where James worked as a principal, Stanton School, in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p>The song’s impact became more apparent during the civil rights movement and the beginning of the National Association of Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).</p><p>In 1917, the NAACP made “Lift Every Voice and Sing” its official song and began referring to it as the “Negro National Anthem,” which was later changed to the Black National Anthem. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The NAACP’s website</a> said the song was also “prominently used as a rallying cry during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>A photo of protestors in Birmingham, Ala., in the 1950s.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sheryl Lee Ralph said she has “classic nerves” ahead of her “Lift Every Voice and Sing” Super Bowl performance.</h2><p>Over the years, “Lift Every Voice and Sing” has made its rounds in mainstream media.

I could hardly move,” Sheryl told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> about her Super Bowl rehearsal. "It was like classic nerves. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm gonna be sick.'
