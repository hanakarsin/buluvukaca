They should look at the South-east and micro-zone it to the South-east to complete this long-awaited cycle for justice and peace.</p><p>“Maybe after four years or after eight years, you might now say okay the cycle is completed. Now, it is an open game for all. But as long as that cycle is not completed, it might be hurting the nation from time to time because something is wrong,” he told ThisDay.</p><p>In a similar development, the Peoples Democratic Party Governors in the South on Saturday insisted that the presidential ticket of the party <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>must be zoned</a></strong> to the region for fairness and equity in 2023.</p><p>The PDP Southern Governors after their meeting on Saturday stressed that they are committed to the party’s unity.</p><p>The Governors noted that the best thing to do for the unity of the main opposition party is to zone its presidential ticket to the South.</p><p>The Vice-Chairman of the PDP Governor’s Forum, Okezie Ikpeazu while speaking on behalf of his colleagues said that they have watched with interest the development of PDP and the issue of zoning ahead of the 2023 general elections.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49yZqKsXaK2qLTTZp%2BuqqRiwamxjKeYraGfo3qwt86rppygkWK0qsLErGSrnZGovK95wKmaZquYpMKtsIyzpqedXWd9c3%2BMqameq5mZsq%2Bv2GarqGWknbJuv86uq6Fn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./300639-government-clarifies-kenya-airways-doesnt-fly-troubled-boeing-737-max-8-jet-html.html><span>←</span><span>Government clarifies Kenya Airways doesn't fly troubled Boeing 737 Max 8 jet</span></a>
