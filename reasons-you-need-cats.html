Now I could chalk it up to it "just not being my thing" but the truth is, because I was told I was a "creative" kid growing up, whatever that meant, and I loved reading after I finally learned how to do it, I was more concerned with sneaking chapters of works of fiction than learning about the krebs cycle. Sorry biology.</p><p>But it pays to know, at least on a basic level, how different organisms function. Maybe if I spent more time paying attention in biology class I would've discovered just how bad Twinkies are for you and stopped eating them earlier. Who am I fooling, my fat butt would've kept chomping down on them regardless, but at least I would've felt guilty while doing it!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>But there are tons of cases of science lessons saving people's lives. My wife, for example, from an episode of Osmosis Jones correctly diagnosed her own appendicitis as a kid. The second they removed the turgid organ from her body, as she recounts it, it exploded in the doctor's hand.</p><p>Some science lessons, however, just don't save lives, they change them forever. Like this one student, while learning about blood types in her biology class, discovered that her familial ties aren't what she thinks they are. And her family never told her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>im in bio class and we’re going over blood type and uhhh.... i think a girl just found out she was adopted omgggggggksnfkekdjjd</p>— ohhhh honey!
