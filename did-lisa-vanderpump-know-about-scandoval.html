And judging by her reaction to Tom’s revelation on Vanderpump Rules, it appears that she was also in the dark.</p><p>During Tom and Lisa’s chat, the restaurateur proceeds not to mince words about Tom’s actions.</p><p>“I know you wanted to see me, Tom. I’ve heard so much,” Lisa says. “I don’t understand a lot of it, to be honest. Ariana’s been here.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Tom shares that he didn’t want to hurt Ariana and that Ariana has “a hard time with trusting people.” And of course, Lisa throws out an obvious dig.</p><p>“Well, what is she going to have now?" Lisa asks Tom with a stone-cold face. “I mean this isn’t a trusting place when you’re sleeping with one of her best friends.”</p><p>Tom proceeds to hyperventilate and cry as Lisa consoles him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Watch What Happens Live!
