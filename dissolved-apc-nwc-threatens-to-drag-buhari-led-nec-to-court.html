Other members include the Governors of Niger and Osun.</p><p>The NEC also ratified all decisions taken in respect of the Edo Guber Primaries, which means <strong>Osagie Ize-Iyamu</strong>&nbsp;can now be recognized by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the authentic candidate of the APC in the September 19, 2020, governorship election in Edo State.</p><p>As part of resolutions, the APC NEC also said all pending court cases against the party and its members have been suspended.</p><p>But reacting in a statement on Thursday evening, the dissolved APC NWC maintained&nbsp;its earlier position that Chief Victor Giadom, a former National Secretary of the party, has no authority to convene a National Executive Committee meeting.</p><p>The 18 members of the NWC referred to Article 25(B) which states the officer(s) of the party empowers to convene a NEC meeting, submitting that Giadom fell short of the provision of the party constitution to summon the meeting.</p><p>The statement reads: “Article 25(B) of the Constitution of the APC is explicit that only the National Chairman or the National Working Committee (NWC) is given the prerogative of summoning meetings of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Party either for statutory quarterly meetings or for emergency meetings. The same provision of the constitution makes it compulsory for a notice of minimum of 14 days in respect statutory quarterly meetings and 7 days in respect of emergency meetings</p><p>“We note that Chief Victor Giadom had convened and conducted a virtual meeting purportedly to be a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of our Party wherein certain far-reaching resolutions were purportedly reached. While the National Working Committee is studying the unfolding drama, it will be consulting with stakeholders and team of lawyers on the next line of action”.</p><p>The 1 members (out of 20) of the NWC that attended it’s meeting are Ntufam Hilliard Etagbo Eta – National Vice Chairman South-South, Hon.
