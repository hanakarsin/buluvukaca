There are tons of countries that have them on their flags. Look at France. Look at Britain. Stars, while not exactly a rarity, are a bit less common. So if you see stars, red, white, and blue on something, your mind automatically thinks 'Murica.</p><p>That's what Dale Cheesman's grandma thought. She's been repping the same fourth of July shirt for more than 25 years. Look at how adorable she is in it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>However, thanks to the 2018 World Cup and the participation of one team, Panama, Dale and his family discovered something about Grandma's shirt.</p><p>She wasn't repping Old Glory at all.
