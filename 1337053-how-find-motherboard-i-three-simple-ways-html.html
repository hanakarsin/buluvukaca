Using inbuilt system tools</h3><p class=align-left>Windows PCs have numerous inbuilt tools meant to help troubleshoot problems, provide device information, and increase a computer's efficiency. Here are some of the tools you can use to find your motherboard (also known as a logic board or mainboard) make, model, and serial number.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/648255ae10537131.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting Google hacks: Top things to do on Google</span></p></a><h4><strong>System Information</strong></h4><p class=align-left>If you are wondering how to see what motherboard I have using the System Information tool, sit back, as it is actually quite easy. System Information is a powerful tool that provides information concerning numerous parts of a Windows PC.</p><li>To access System Information, click on the search bar and type 'System Information' or use the <i>Run </i>dialogue to bring it up. In the latter case, you should type <i>msinfo32.exe</i> into the <i>Run </i>dialogue box.</li><li>Once System Information launches, scroll down to system summary and locate a section named <i>Baseboard Manufacturer, Logic Board Manufacturer</i>, or <i>Motherboard Manufacturer</i>. This will contain all the available system information regarding the motherboard that Windows can access.</li><p class=align-left>While this may seem like the most straightforward method, it often has some blatant limitations. At the very least, you will find out your computer's logic board manufacturer. However, you will probably not find out the motherboard's exact make number using this method.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ff804667606c6ba.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why Datacomm Express is the store for all your tech needs: Contacts, address and products</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/648255ae10537131.jpeg><p class=align-left>On some makes, though, System Information displays additional information about the mainboard that includes the device number.</p><h4><strong>Command Prompt</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Command Prompt is the inbuilt command line interpreter for Microsoft operating systems such as Windows 7, 8.0, 8.1 and 10.

Examining your motherboard physically</h3><p class=align-left>Are you wondering how to know what motherboard I have through physical examination? If you are comfortable prying electronic appliances open, then this might actually be the best way to find out your PC's baseboard make.</p><p class=align-left>Here is a detailed guide on how to check motherboard using this method.</p><li>Make sure your computer is properly powered down. Do not attempt this method when the computer is in a powered state such as 'on' or 'sleep.'</li><li>Unplug all peripheral devices from your computer. This includes audio cables, VGA cables, HDMI cables, Ethernet, audio, and power connectors. External mice and keyboards should also be disconnected.</li><li>One of the most crucial steps in figuring out how to check motherboard model physically involves grounding yourself. Electronic components inside a computer often have significant levels of static electricity. It is important to ground yourself before touching any of these components. This helps prevent one from discharging static electricity upon coming into contact with the components.</li><li>Pry open the lid/cover. Ensure that the components attached to the motherboard are facing upwards. The uneven protrusions of different components might lead to damage if placed facing the work surface.</li><li>Once the lid is open, it is time to locate the motherboard and its device number. In most cases, this is usually printed on the motherboard, but can be located in several other locations such as between PCIe slots, RAM slots, or near the CPU socket.</li><li>What kind of motherboard do I have if I cannot find the manufacturer's name? In some cases, there may only be a device number without a manufacturer listed. If this is the case, you might have to try another method. However, many modern motherboards will list both the manufacturer and model.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f4494f44a15cf4b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top tips on how to view Facebook profile as public</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Keep in mind that there will be a lot of writing on the motherboard, but the device number is usually written in the largest font. Motherboard device numbers are typically a collection of numbers and letters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1d9bc61bad09783e.jpeg><p class=align-left>If you do not find the manufacturer's name printed on any component, feel free to use motherboard detector sites on the internet. To do this, simply type the device number into any search engine console and add the word 'motherboard' after the number.</p><p class=align-left>While this is often hit-or-miss, you might get relevant results to point you to your PC's board manufacturer.</p><p class=align-left>Here are some of the most common logic board manufacturers to help you first locate the manufacturer's name once you open up your computer.</p><ul><li>ASRock</li><li>ASUS (or ASUSTeK)</li><li>Biostar</li><li>EVGA</li><li>Gigabyte</li><li>MSI</li></ul><p class=align-left>At times, you might find the manufacturer's logo but without an accompanying device name. In this case, see whether you can locate the motherboard's chipset. To find this, look for a four-digit alphanumeric code that starts with a letter followed by three numbers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c72179698a40a4ad.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Flash Fill Excel: Find out how to use it quite easily</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So, for example, if you found the Asus logo and a code H416, it would mean that your logic board manufacturer is Asus, and the device number is H416.</p><h3>3. Using third-party software</h3><p class=align-left>If you are uncomfortable opening your computer or typing commands on the Command Prompt interface, then you can determine your device's logic board model by using third-party software. Here is a guide on how to check what logic board I have by making use of third-party applications.</p><li>Download your preferred software. There are scores of these third-party apps available online. Some of the most common ones include CPU-Z and Speccy.</li><li>Install the applications and run them. The motherboard detection procedure will vary depending on the software you chose.</li><p class=align-left>Keep in mind that not all tools are available for free download. For some, you will have to make a one-off or periodic payments.</p><h2>What is my motherboard on Ubuntu?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0073376d4cdbaa35_w.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Step-by-step guide on how to save a Word document as a PDF</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What motherboard do I have on an Ubuntu system such as Linux Mint?
