They may do it, but that doesn't make it right</i>," Pastor Chris said.</p><p>He said being married to a man of God doesn’t automatically make you a woman of God and that is why you don't really find wives of Men of God listed in the Bible.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome’s Divorce Saga Gets Messier</a></p><p>Addressing reports in the media concerning the divorce saga, he said some of the media houses particularly in Nigeria and South Africa have been writing some very stupid things.</p><p>He criticized them for prying into his private life while also calling on his church members to pray for his estranged wife.</p><p>The pastor said: "<i>I wasn't accused of those things you (media houses) said, nor did I commit those stupid things that you said and I don't need to go to that level and such discussions. Jesus Christ was accused by many, with lots of frivolous charges. There would always be those who'd like for it to be true, but you know, in spite of the accusations against Jesus, it didn't change who he was</i>!"</p><p>Pastor Chris said there was a difference between being a preacher and Man of God and he is not a preacher but a man of God.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Founding Church Member Reveals More About Oyakhilomes Divorce</a></p><p>He said: "<i>There are preachers and there are Men of God. You have to understand something about a Man of God. A man of God is not just someone who worships God or who preaches God. A man of God is directed by God, set on course by God</i>."</p><p>He therefore advised his members to be wise, stay focused on the word of God, judge nothing before its time and not allow those who want to feast on the divorce saga and make something big out of it.</p><p>See the video version of the message below:</p><p></p><p>Oyakhilome’s church, Believers Love World Inc popularly known as Christ Embassy is regarded as one of the biggest denominations in Nigeria with membership in thousands and branches all over world.</p><p>News of the divorce between Pastor Chris and wife, Rev. Anita Oyakhilome has been trending on social media. On August 29, reports surfaced online that <a href=#>Rev. Anita&nbsp; filed an action at a UK court to end their 20-year-old marriage on the grounds of “adultery” and “unreasonable behaviour”</a>. It was later reported that the <a href=#>church had removed every information about Rev. Anita Oyakhilome including her pictures</a>&nbsp; from its website, <i>www.christembassy. org</i>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome has <a href=#>threatened to sue journalists for publishing news of their divorce</a>.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3mClXBsZp6Zo66tuNhmp5qrpKS%2Fbq%2FHq6CsZZ%2Burqy0yKWmpp1dqL2mrcqsZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMmqOlnZeWwaq7zaxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./court-sacks-timipre-sylva-as-bayelsa-apc-governorship-candidate.html><span>←</span><span>Court Sacks Timipre Sylva As Bayelsa APC Governorship Candidate</span></a>
