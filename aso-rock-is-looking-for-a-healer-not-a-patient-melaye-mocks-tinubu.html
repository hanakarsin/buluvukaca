I call on the NDLEA Chairman, Buba Marwa, to take Atiku and Tinubu for drug tests because anyone who will be our president must be free of drugs. This is important as our country is battling the scourge of drug abuse.</p><p>“Tinubu is not fit. I challenge him to a medical examination and Atiku will do the same. We want to see if Tinubu’s pronouncement of agbado, cassava and 50 million youths to be employed in the army and people tweeting on WhatsApp are mere statements or if they were made out of mental imbalance.</p><p>“Aso Rock is looking for a healer, not a patient. Nigerians don’t want another president that will be visiting London every week and cause us economic and social distractions.”</p><h2>Obi Not A President Material</h2><p>Melaye also opined that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, <strong>Peter Obi</strong>, does not have what it takes to lead and unite the country.</p><p>The former lawmaker claimed that any vote for the LP candidate is a vote for Tinubu to become the next President because Obi does not have the qualities of a Nigerian leader.</p><p>He, however, lauded Obi’s work ethic but said the Labour Party did not have the spread to win a presidential election for now.</p><p>He said, “Peter Obi has no capacity to unite this country. You don’t give a carpentry job to a tailor. Nigerians must know that any vote for Peter Obi is a vote for the APC because Obi cannot make it. Anybody campaigning for Obi is actually working for Tinubu to become the President.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49vZpqrn2K%2FsK%2FKZqCsZZykvKy1zaBkn6eiYq5utMSao56qXaO8tXnAZqearJmau7V5zJ6jmrGVYrqwr8qsZK2hnqqvtns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./281525-rais-uhuru-alimpia-bili-ya-hospitali-msanii-mkongwe-wa-kikuyu-aliyelezwa-mp-shah-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rais Uhuru alimpia bili ya hospitali msanii mkongwe wa Kikuyu aliyelezwa MP Shah</span></a>
