Then, she mixes equal parts baking soda, soap, and vinegar to form a bubbly paste.</p><p>"Wipe the entire inside of your oven with the paste. Let it sit two to three hours, wipe down with a Brillo pad, and it comes out spotless." OK, fine that's FIVE items you need for it. Gia shows off a squeaky clean oven in her video as a result of her hard work and ingenuity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">However there are a lot of people who aren't fans of the now-viral TikTok oven cleaning hack.</h2><p>Multiple users complained that Gia's method requires more work than is necessary to clean an oven, and some said that the mixture led to a deluge of suds that took forever to get out.

The steam breaks down/cleans all of the particles and nasty bits in the oven that can then be easily wiped off.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Have you tried the brand spanking new TikTok oven hack?
