On his album "The Life of Pablo," West called Swift a "bitch" and also referred to them having sex.&nbsp;</p><p>Swift then implied that she took issue with West's words in a series of speeches and statements—that was, until Kim Kardashian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a> video on Snapchat of Swift and West talking on the phone in which it sounds like Swift is giving her enthusiastic permission.&nbsp;</p><p>She was dubbed a "snake," and the snake emoji is such a stand in for Taylor Swift's name on the Internet that Instagram basically <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">figured out a way</a> to just block emojis for her. Doesn't stop people from using them though:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait it's legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍</p>— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) <a href=#>July 17, 2016</a></figure><p>Since this very public take down, Swift has made a series of strange social media choices. She had a brief relationship with Tom Hiddleston, which many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">derided as fake</a>. Since then, Swift has kind of gone underground, even foregoing her traditional Fourth of July party full of perfect photo ops with her girl squad. And then this week, her social media got strange. Her photo avatar is deleted from Twitter, as are all of her tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>Except these:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/p2DyY0e2M3</a></p>— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=#>August 21, 2017</a></figure><p>A ten second silent video of what appears to be a snake posted on Monday, followed by a slightly longer version on Tuesday:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/12Rfi8bso4</a></p>— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=#>August 22, 2017</a></figure><p>No one is sure what's coming, but they're scared:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>kim and kanye right now <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PcvxmLEXSK</a></p>— raphael gomes (@raphablueberry) <a href=#>August 22, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me right now. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZlTkbQlVcG</a></p>— Perez (@ThePerezHilton) <a href=#>August 22, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hCgd6xeFKD</a></p>— Alina (@TrueSwiftie) <a href=#>August 22, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My <a href=#>#ts6</a> tour outfit is ready <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iBiSqdBVfw</a></p>— hiss hiss bish (@tedddypicker) <a href=#>August 22, 2017</a></figure><p>The final outcome hasn't yet been dropped, whether it's a single, an entire album, or an announcement that Swift is going to go work at the zoo. But it definitely reads as a response to her haters, critics, and anyone who has ever hit send on the snake emoji.
