We are not happy with the plethora of court cases by members who have remained adamant and refused to withdraw cases.“</p><p dir=ltr>The PUNCH also alleged that a lawyer handling one of the cases in the court had disclosed that, “The APC is now in a quagmire. Several cases have been instituted challenging the legitimacy of Buni’s committee. Should that committee go ahead with the convention and the court rules that Buni’s committee is illegal, then the convention is null and void.</p><p dir=ltr>“Also, the APC cannot decide on its own to recognise any faction until the courts have decided. If for instance in Zamfara State, Governor Matawalle’s faction takes part in the convention and the court later recognises former Governor Yari’s faction, then the entire convention has a legitimacy issue and may have to be conducted all over again.</p><p dir=ltr>“If such a thing happens across four states, then you can be sure that the convention will have to be done all over again,” the lawyer added.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> learnt that in another exclusive interview, a chieftain of the APC in Kwara State told The PUNCH that it was unlikely that the APC would be able to hold its convention in February.</p><p dir=ltr>He said, “The committee is expected to meet with us in Kwara in the second week of January. And the convention is slated for February. From the look of things, they will not be able to complete their task before the convention.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5JqZpqok2K7osDIqKWapF2YvK%2FCxKeroqeeYsCtrdOem2aen6d6p7HBq6yaqqlitq95w6ism6xdlsBuvMSamp5loJa7priMn6OoqKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-disney-channel.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to the Disney Channel and Is It Shutting Down in 2022?</span></a>
