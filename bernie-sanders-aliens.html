Listen up, earthlings: We've got all the details!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">If Bernie Sanders learns that aliens exist, he will tell the American people.&amp;#xA0;</h2><p>Joe's saved his most pressing question for the Vermont senator until the end of their interview. "One last question," he said. "If you got into the office and you found out something about <a href=#>aliens</a>, if you found out something about UFOs, would you let us know?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, I'll tell you," Bernie said. "My wife would demand that I let you know!"</p><p>Joe wanted to know if Bernie's wife, Jane O'Meara Sanders, was "a UFO nut." The presidential hopeful said she wasn't, but she would be curious. He also reassured Joe and the audience that he currently doesn't have access to any secret files about aliens.&nbsp;</p><p>If Bernie is elected and learns something top secret about aliens, though, he joked to Joe, "We'll announce it on this show! How's that?"&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">President Donald Trump doesn&amp;apos;t think aliens exist, but he&amp;apos;s open to the possibility.&amp;#xA0;</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>, President Trump said, "Well, I don't want to really get into it too much. &nbsp;But personally, I tend to doubt it."</p><p>"I'm not a believer," he clarified, "but you know, I guess anything is possible."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Former POTUS Barack ObamaBarack Obama playfully denied having any knowledge of aliens.</h2><p>In a 2015 <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>, then-president Barack ObamaBarack Obama laughed it off when the late-night host grilled him about the possible existence of aliens.&nbsp;</p><p>"I can't reveal anything," he said with a smile.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Jimmy Kimmel Live/YouTube</span></figure><p>"Really?" <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a> asked.
