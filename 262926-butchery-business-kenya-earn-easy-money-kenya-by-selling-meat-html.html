Meat supply business in Kenya is a booming business because of the lifestyle that Kenyans have chosen to lead.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f2b9a6d8f39142ce.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a water bottling company in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Entertainment joints would not be what they are today without meat.

There are other essential equipment that will make your meat shop run effectively. Ensure that you have chopping boards, updated weighing scales, display counters (visible), freezer, knives and wrapping materials. You also need to have cleaning equipment and white coats. These items will give customers confidence in the meat products.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f2b9a6d8f39142ce.jpeg><h2>How much would it cost to start a butchery in Kenya?</h2><p class=align-left>A butchery in Kenya will cost you anything from 50,000 to one million shillings. The secret is its location. Urban center butcheries will obviously cost more to start compared to those in the rural areas. Either way, having enough money to set up a butchery is necessary considering that the license alone costs 26,000 shillings.</p><h2>Butchery business in Kenya – guaranteed success</h2><p class=align-left>This is the kind of business that you start knowing that you will get money for it as long as you get the location right. Kenyans love meat. If you can supply the best quality, then you are assured of long-term business. Get your house in order; hire people you can trust because the only way your butchery can fail to perform when all other factors are right is if someone is stealing from you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/890c5a52e8e0af9b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 profitable businesses to start with 50k in Kenya (top ideas)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many people have asked ‘are meat markets profitable?’ The fear of making loses is real. However, with a good butcher shop book keeping practice, all your records will guide you on your profit-loss ratios.</p><h2>Butcher shop revenue – what to expect</h2><p class=align-left>You are sure to make profits. The meat prices are regulated in such a way that the owner will earn some good money. This can increase if you choose to cook the meat and serve with other dishes in addition to selling raw meat. You should thus stop wondering how much does a butcher shop owner make does. You can make as much as you want if you are creative. The truth is that you are hardly ever going to make loses unless there is theft.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3f64df660b27019b.jpeg><h2>Butchery business plan – planning is succeeding</h2><p class=align-left>A smart person starts a business which they understand. Have a breakdown of your potential expenditure which should include labor, equipment, rental costs, capital for product and any other miscellaneous costs expected. The next move should be to calculate potential sales with high and low expectations. This will help you estimate the possible profit margins, loses and break-even points. With such information, you can venture into the business with your mind settled and mentally prepared for the outcome as you hope for the best.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1cbl5qffte5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Butternut Farming in Kenya- Growing Pumpkins Made Easier</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With meat loving Kenyans though, success in a butchery business is almost always given.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BlWtwa25dl8K1r8eeqbJlkqrAqrrErKpmo5WjxqJ5xJqpp2WVlsC6ecyopZ6xXaCyr8XAZpmyZaOaua21zaBkpp2RqXupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./atiku-reacts-as-president-buhari-signs-electoral-bill.html><span>←</span><span>Atiku Reacts As President Buhari Signs Electoral Bill</span></a>
