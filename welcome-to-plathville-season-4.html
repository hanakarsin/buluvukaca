Now, it's basically unfathomable to think of not being able to see the Plath kids continue to grow up and stand up to their parents' strict rules. But will there be a Season 4 of Welcome to Plathville?</p><p>The first three seasons are a whirlwind of the older Plath kids finding their bearings outside of the family home. Ethan Plath discovers a world of sugar, alcoholic beverages, and "worldly" television shows. Moriah Plath breaks out on her own and enters into a romantic relationship for the first time. Micah Plath is pursuing a modeling career. It's hardly time to say goodbye to them for good.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span><p>Barry and Kim Plath from 'Welcome to Plathville.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Will there be a Season 4 of 'Welcome to Plathville'?</h2><p>TLC announced in a press release that Season 4 of Welcome to Plathville premieres on May 17, 2022 at 10 p.m. ET on TLC. The fourth season will continue to follow some of the older Plath kids as they get settled in Florida, where they moved at the end of Season 3.</p><p>While Ethan, Olivia, and Moriah are in Florida, Micah is working on his modeling career in Los Angeles.</p><p>According to the press release, "Kim is questioning their lifestyle and her choices overall, and some unexpected alliances and friendships occur as a result. As the Plaths explore new cities, navigate their love lives, change and grow in ways none of them ever expected, what's certain is the recent past never seemed so far behind."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span><p>Lydia Plath from 'Welcome to Plathville.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How many episodes is Season 4 of 'Welcome to Plathville'?</h2><p>Season 4 of Welcome to Plathville is 12 episodes long. Season 1 had just six episodes, and Season 2 was given nine. Since Season 3 was 12 episodes, it makes sense for TLC to greenlight the same number for Season 4, which should be as dramatic as ever if the older Plath kids have anything to say about it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Season 4 could explore Lydia Plath's story a little more.</h2><p>Most fans are clamoring to know what happens with Ethan and Olivia on Welcome to Plathville. Their marriage is on shaky ground, and Kim and Barry Plath don't make things any easier for them. However, Ethan's younger sister, <a href=#>Lydia Plath</a>, takes some of the spotlight in Season 3 as she tries to connect with a boy she has a crush on.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lydia Plath (@lydiajoyplath)</a></p></figure><p>Lydia's storyline could take more of a front-row seat in Season 4. Unlike some of her older siblings, Lydia isn't dying to leave home and her parents' rules behind, but she does show hints of doubt at their teachings and seems to want to explore life as a young adult.</p><p>Following Season 3, Lydia started her own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> account and went on social media for the first time. It's clear that she wants to branch out a little bit more that her parents are ready for.</p><p>Season 4 could be her time to shine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLKtr86mnGasn2K9ra3Toa2ipJyaerSxwKymp2Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-moon-tea-house-of-the-dragon.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Moon Tea in House of the Dragon?</span></a>
