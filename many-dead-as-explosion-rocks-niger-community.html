We lost four of our security personnel who were in our security vehicle that ran on the bomb.</p><p>“I and other security agencies are yet to get to the point where the explosion took place because we are waiting for the bomb experts to inform us of the safety of the areas before we can go there.”</p><p>Confirming the attack in a statement, the spokesman of the Niger Police Command, <strong>Wasiu Abiodun</strong>, said that terrorists attacked the village in the early hours of Monday.</p><p>The statement reads: “The Niger State Police Command wishes to confirm that on 21/02/2022 at about 0100hrs, armed bandits/terrorists attacked Galadima-Kogo village, Shiroro LGA killing about six persons and set some houses ablaze,” the statement reads.</p><p>“However, joint tactical teams comprised of the Military, Police, NSCDC and Vigilantes were mobilised to the scene, and unfortunately while on their way, a truck with NSCDC personnel ran into an Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) planted by bandits/insurgents along the routes and exploded.</p><p>“Consequently, as a result of the IED explosion, four NSCDC personnel lost their lives, while the driver sustained serious injuries and presently receiving treatment in a hospital, in Minna.”</p><p>“The Commissioner of Police, Bala Kuryas, has deployed the Police Explosive Ordinance Unit (EOD) to sweep the area with a view to defusing other IEDs that might have been planted in the area, while one of the notorious bandits/insurgents was apprehended and investigation is ongoing as the suspect is undergoing interrogation in Police custody”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FqZqaZnq56pbHAnWSaq12axbG4zqygqKZdp7ykt9JmpaKflad6pLvMpqynoaSufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./july12-html.html><span>←</span><span>July 12 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
