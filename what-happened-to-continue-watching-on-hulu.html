Usually, the section appears near the top of your app, and gives you a handy way to dip back in to things that you've already started.</p><p>Now that the category is missing, though, many users have taken to the internet to complain and ask when the feature may return.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The category is missing due to a glitch.</h2><p>Hulu's support team has been actively engaging with users on Twitter and other platforms, apologizing for the issue and saying that it was totally unintentional.</p><p>“Apologies for the inconvenience! This behavior is under investigation at this time, and we hope to have it cleared up soon. We appreciate your patience while we work to get this resolved!” one Hulu reply to an aggravated user said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Hulu here — sorry about that!

These potential fixes include closing the app, uninstalling and reinstalling it, and checking your connection. You can see the full list of potential <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fixes here</a>, although some people may just have to be patient and wait for Hulu to resolve the issue.</p><p>These kinds of streaming glitches can be incredibly annoying, especially when you've just settled down to watch the latest episode of The Bachelorette or whatever else you've been working your way through lately.</p><p>Thankfully, though, Hulu hopped on the issue quickly and is working to resolve it.</p><p>There are plenty of issues with social media and other streaming services that never get addressed at all, so the fact that Hulu jumped on the issue and is now in the process of fixing it hopefully means that it should be a very temporary issue.</p><p>As of right now, there's no indication as to what caused the problem, but it seems likely that it was just an issue with the code.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScp56ptq%2FBxGaumqyTnbavs4yopWagpaHC</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sort-yourself-out-at-appeal-court-judge-tells-saraki-in-suit-against-efcc-others.html><span>←</span><span>Sort Yourself Out At Appeal Court</span></a>
