But wait, hold on because there's a burning question on everyone's minds: Will there be a juicy reunion special this time?</p><p>Season 1 notably lacked such an exciting event — so what's the story behind that? Well, in an exclusive interview with Distractify, <a href=#>Jordan Emanuel</a> shed some light on these queries.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Kareem Black/Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why wasn't there a reunion for 'Summer House: Martha's Vineyard' Season 1?</h2><p>Jordan told Distractify that while she and the rest of the Summer House: Martha's Vineyard cast would've "loved" to sit down for a reunion, it just wasn't in the cards timing-wise. She explained, "I think everybody would have loved to have made it work, but I just don't think, realistically, like it was gonna happen."</p><p>"It just became a logistics thing more than anything else," Jordan continued. "As far as exposure, I mean, of course, I'm always gonna say, 'Yeah, I want more' because I'm proud of us. I'm proud of the work we've done and our dynamic. I think we put a lot into it by exposing our real relationships, and our real thoughts, and our real feelings, especially as Black people, quite frankly.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Jordan concluded, "So yeah, of course, I'm always going to say like, I want everybody to see it, and I want everyone to be talking about it, naturally. But I mean, I think my expectations were exceeded, regardless, because I certainly wasn't expecting people to recognize me on the street, especially like nine months later, you know?"</p><p>Season 2 of Summer House: Martha's Vineyard premieres Sunday, March 24, at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo. New episodes will air on Sundays at 9 p.m. EST, and they will be available to stream on Peacock the next day.</p><p>Reporting by Elizabeth Randolph</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6edaaqqesXam1pr7EZphmq6Wiuqa%2BjKGmrquVYrq3edGerKehn6N6tLHArKanZWE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./317558-obasanjo-women-more-reliable-than-men-in-politics-html.html><span>←</span><span>Obasanjo: Women More Reliable Than Men In Politics</span></a>
