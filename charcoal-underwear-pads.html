It's called the Flatulence Deodorizer, a it's a charcoal-based pad that attaches to your underwear so you can fart freely without having to worry about other people smelling them.&nbsp;</p><p>Made by Flat-D Innovations, Inc its website boasts that the product is like "wearing activated charcoal underwear but much more economical."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The company's website goes on to explain how the filters work:&nbsp;</p><p>"The material we use is approximately 1/16th of an inch thick and can be washed repeatedly and still maintain its effectiveness. It comes laminated on both sides, with a thin polyester type material, which provides strength and durability. The material is breathable, lightweight, reusable, washable and easily installed. Due to its slim profile, the wearer is comfortably unaware of its presence."&nbsp;</p><p>The company goes on to assure that the materials used are safe:</p><p>"The material is very safe when worn touching the skin. There are no harmful side-effects either. You can use your own underwear and insert this when needed. It is hypoallergenic and in all of our tests we have not found anyone allergic to the material."&nbsp;</p><p>It also says that "activated carbon acts much like a sponge absorbing water, except that the carbon absorbs the gaseous materials at a micro level. Activated charcoal holds onto the material it has absorbs quite well. There is no risk in the environment of usage that an active carbon filter will give up the material it has captured."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Makes it possible for me to continue sleeping in the same room with my husband," one user wrote. "They work extremely well, but you do have to situate directly up to the bum. They don't really work if you place between the cheeks and undies."</p><p>Another person wrote:</p><p>"In my office, I am known as a notorious "crop-duster". I can't help it. You can't help what nature has intended your body to do. Plants even pass gas and we don't complain about it; in fact we just plant more and are encouraged to so! Anyway, I bought about 10 of these with my last paycheck (sorry, Fluffy, you're eating newspaper scraps for the next week), and my co-workers no longer complain about me and my "crop dusting."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Twitter users also seem impressed with the idea behind the product.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Underwear with flatulence deodorizer pad.
