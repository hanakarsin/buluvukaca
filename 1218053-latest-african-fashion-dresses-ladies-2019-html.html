He said:</p>As much as trends are significant and are moving swiftly in Africa and the world, there are basic or classic styles that have existed, and with the incorporation of trends, we still work around them. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/9677186df61c5fc5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What are the different aesthetics popular with today’s youth?</span></p></a>Let's say a bold African woman or a boss lady would like to stand out, and that's why a suitable pant is a must-have piece, an ideal trend, and a bold office and everyday look for a woman who wants to own her space and be comfortable at the same time. However, a woman who has mastered the classic style and set out to create her style might not want the ordinary pants you see daily. So that's where the trend comes in.As a brand, our focus is not on trends because most of the time, if you follow the trend, you will lose your brand identity, and if you lose your ethos, you will lose your clients because trends just come and go. But suppose you have an intense look that is inter-seasonal and functional simultaneously. In that case, your client will be stuck with you and keep coming to you again because they see consistency and originality. You can incorporate a new trend at the same time maintaining your originality. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/3c94f40b854d9e99.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest George styles: blouses and gowns for traditional marriage</span></p></a><h2 id=1218053-latest-african-fashion-dresses-for-ladies-in-2024 class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Latest African fashion dresses for ladies in 2024</h2><p class=align-left>It is not unusual to find <a href=#>people</a> looking at pictures of African dress designs for couples in 2024.

He said:</p>This is what our brand is all about – blending afro-luxurious heritage with ethical elegance. If you check out our <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> and some of our pieces on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">IG</a> (Instagram), we are a brand deeply rooted in deconstruction, reconstruction, and blending African luxury with modern aesthetics.We work with denim (jeans) and our traditionally handwoven fabric called smock from northern Ghana. We work with denim a lot because of its versatility and durability. It has been in existence for ages, and it keeps evolving.Our (Ghana) smock fabric resembles Ghana's famous Kente Fabric and Nigerian Aso-oke. In Ghana, we call it Smock or Fugu. So these are the two main fabrics we work with all the time.This item blends the African elements with the modern twist and the Western fabric perfectly. That's one beautiful thing about an African brand trying to gain ascendancy in the global market. You remember the African element, the African fabric, in a way that even when you go international, you will still have even the people in the West accepting it. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/22b44c8ce6fbdeaf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75+ small women's unique hand tattoos to enhance your look</span></p></a>Smock has different elements and varieties that, when appropriately merged, attract people from the West and people here (in Africa).
