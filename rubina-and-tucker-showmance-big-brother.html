Since it first premiered in 2000, the fandom has grown strong. Gameplayers who went on to become fan favorites have become celebrities in their own right. Winners <a href=#>Rachel Reilly</a> and <a href=#>Dan Gheesling</a> were even featured in Seasons 1 and 2 of Peacock's <a href=#>The Traitors</a>, respectively. Fans love the drama Big Brother brings, but that's not all.</p><p>There is nothing better than a slow-simmering romance in any form of entertainment. There's something about the tension and build-up that makes that first kiss so very exciting to watch. When it comes to Big Brother, there have been <a href=#>plenty of "showmances"</a> over the years. It makes absolute sense; if you cram a bunch of people into one house, someone is bound to get a little touchy-feely.</p><p>Viewers are in the midst of such a showmance between <a href=#>two particular</a> houseguests: Rubina Bernabe and Tucker Des Lauriers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tucker Des Lauriers and Rubina Bernabe formed a connection quickly, and have been teasing fans with their burgeoning showmance.</h2><p>Flirtation is bound to happen when a bunch of people, some of whom are conventionally attractive, live under one roof. Especially when no contact is allowed with the outside world. While some shows do this with the purpose of love, like <a href=#>Love Island</a>, Big Brother is a game, and any showmance is 100 percent incidental, if you don't include potential <a href=#>producer interference</a>. There has been a lot of flirtation on Big Brother 26, but viewers are quickly obsessing over just how cute Tucker and Rubina are.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Season 26 of 'Big Brother' is screaming, "Showmances, and no-mances, and, triangles! Oh my!"</h2><p>Season 26 is bringing all the drama and mess in the best way possible. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsie Baham</a> brilliantly broke down all the crushes and showmances within the house in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a hilarious clip</a>. In it, she mentions her crush on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cam Sullivan-Brown</a>. Cam has a crush on <a href=#>Leah Peters</a>, who has a crush on Tyler, who, she asserts, loves the fish in the fish tank. However, it has become clear that Tyler has set his sights on Rubina, as their flirting has gone up a few levels, and now fans are yearning for the duo to kiss.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The showmance between Rubina Berabe and Tyler Des Lauriers is simmering, but will it reach the next step?</h2><p>On the Aug. 7 episode of Big Brother 26, a lot happened. Tyler, who is in love with the fish (allegedly) and is in like with Rubina, made <a href=#>a game-changing</a> move that shook viewers everywhere. Prior to that, he and Rubina had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cuddle session</a> that drove fans crazy. One fan gushed over one intimate moment <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on X, writing</a>, "rubina grabbing tucker by the shoulders and him pulling her by the waist as they lock eyes and then he asks for a KISS PLSSSS," later adding, "OH TUBINA RISEEE!"
