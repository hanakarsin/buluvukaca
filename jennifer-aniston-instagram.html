Will she post recipes and workouts? Nobody knows, but based on her first post, it looks like her Instagram account is going to be everything I have personally ever wanted.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">... Isn't that just&nbsp;"kick you in the crotch, spit on your neck" fantastic?</h2><p>Oh, indeed. Despite voicing her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previous hesitations regarding Instagram</a>, Jen is finally embracing the modern age, at long last. That's right ‚Äî after way too long, she's buckled down and joined the social media app... and IDK about you, but&nbsp;it's a total dream come true.</p><p>The 50-year-old actress'&nbsp;IG bio reads, "my friends call me Jen,"&nbsp;and Ohhhh. My. God. Her first-ever post was seriously fantastic.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>And now we‚Äôre Instagram FRIENDS too.

It's a recently-taken snapshot featuring none other than her five Friends co-stars: David Schwimmer, Courtney Cox, Matthew Perry,&nbsp;Matt LeBlanc, and&nbsp;Lisa Kudrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Check it out above, and also, try not to cry.</p><p>Jen's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram caption</a> reads, "And now we‚Äôre Instagram FRIENDS too. HI INSTAGRAM üëãüèª." I'm not crying, you're crying.&nbsp;</p><p>A number of Jen's famous friends commented on the photo welcoming her to the social media app. Reese Witherspoon, who appeared as the sister of Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) commented, "YASSSS!!! Welcome to Insta Jen!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®üòç," while&nbsp;<a href=#>tennis player Maria Sharapova </a>said, "Best news this Tuesday!! üíïüíï." And TBH, I could not agree more.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jennifer Aniston was hesitant to sign up for Instagram, but alas ‚Äî&nbsp;"the break" is finally over.</h2><p>Jen had been feeling a tremendous amount of pressure to sign up for the app, according to ET Online. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said she didn't want to</a>, because of social media's overwhelming societal presence.</p><p>"What you resist, persists... it's something that is a part of our world now and it's not going away," she said in an interview with ET Online's&nbsp;Brooke Anderson.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Courtesy of Warner Bros.</span></figure><p>However, I guess that all ended up being a moo point, because Jen&nbsp;finally has an account. Thank the smelly cat lovin' gods.</p><p>While I'm not entirely sure what could have persuaded Jen to create an account after such a long wait, many speculate her change of heart could be somewhat related to <a href=#>the 25th Friends reunion</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year marked <a href=#>25 years since the first episode of Friends&nbsp;premiered</a>, which is obviously a big deal. Did she create the account to reunite with her co-stars, or as a gift to fans who were there for her from the start?&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what her motive was. Maybe she just wanted to see what it was all about. But really, I'm just grateful she's finally come to terms with the fact that Instagram users needed a little more Rachel Green realness in their feeds.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvusifnKtlkaO2tMDOp2SipqOprqi%2BwKY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./francesca-battistelli-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Francesca Battistelli - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
