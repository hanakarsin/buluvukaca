Details</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>If you've been following his life as of late, then you know that it has been quite a rough couple of years for professional skateboarder <a href=#>Bam Margera</a>. Bam made headlines for his heavy drug and alcohol abuse, his arrest and nervous breakdown, and finally for seeking help from Dr. Phil (after pushing all of his loved ones away — something he worked through with Dr. Phil on-air).</p><p>After his talk with Dr. Phil, Bam seemed to want to get better <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">because of his son, Phoenix</a>. "He's perfect. I can't even put it into words. Like, I would dive into any train or anything and get stabbed or shot or whatever just to make sure he didn't," Bam told Dr. Phil.</p><p>Now, a new Jackass movie is in the works, and despite the personal issues that he has faced as of late, will Bam be in the film? Keep reading to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bam Margera will actually be in one scene in the new 'Jackass' film.</h2><p>After a lot of controversy surrounding his alcohol and drug usage, Johnny Knoxville confirmed in a new interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that Bam will indeed be returning for one scene in Jackass Forever.</p><p>Despite being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sued</a> for testing positive for Adderall after claiming that he would go clean while filming, Bam was still listed as one of the film's 49 credits and appears in it for a few minutes.</p><p>Johnny told Variety during their expansive chat that "We wanted him all throughout the movie, but unfortunately that’s not the way it worked out. It’s really heartbreaking. I love Bam. We all love Bam. He’s our brother, you know? You just hope that he takes it upon himself to get the help that he needs because we all care about him a lot."</p><p>With Bam's inclusion in the film, it seems as though he, his castmates, and the film's creators were able to smooth things over (at least in some regard).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Initially, Bam Margera wasn't going to be a part of the new 'Jackass' movie's cast.</h2><p>Back in 2021, fans began getting concerned that Bam wouldn't take part in the next Jackass film. The actor posted a couple of now-deleted videos to Instagram, saying that he was cut from the fourth movie — and he seemed pretty unhappy about it at the time.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN</a>, Bam was reportedly cut at the time due to concerns about his drinking, as he claimed he had to do frequent breathalyzer tests, urine samples, and stay on his medication.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"Who the f--k cares if I'm drunk as hell anymore? Jackass has put me through hell on f--king wheels for a year and a half," Bam said. "I wrote them so many ideas, and if I'm not in the movie and they use my ideas," he said, "how do you think that will make me feel? The last thing I want to do is be in a courtroom with [director] Jeff Tremaine. I love him. But f--k, man, I'm not in Jackass 4? If anybody cares about me, don't go see their movie, because I will make mine way f--king radder if you just Venmo me a dollar."</p><p>Bam was openly upset about being cut, admitting just how much the franchise meant to him. He took being excluded from the film's cast so harshly that the skateboarder even tried to start a rival series for Jackass, asking his followers to Venmo him money to kickstart the project.</p><p>"If anybody cares about me at all, then throw me a f--king bone and send a dollar to this Venmo, and the more you send, the radder s--t we can do, and I give everyone f--king credit for it," he said. "Like, I can't compete with their $10 million, ladies and gentlemen, but if I had that, I would blow them out of the f--king water."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It's hard to picture a movie about dudes doing dangerous, stupid stuff without some of the original gang. It was basically a rite of passage to watch grown men sit in a limo full of bees or dress up as mice and walk through a room filled with mouse traps (there were much much worse stunts, but we won't get into them).</p><p>This will also be the first Jackass film without Ryan Dunn, who was killed in a car accident in 2011 (not including Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, which came out in 2013).</p><p>Thankfully, fans won't be missing Bam as originally feared, and the remaining original Jackass crew has clearly worked hard on Jackass Forever to still deliver the same level of intensity and hilarity that they have for years.</p><p>Be sure to check out Jackass Forever when it hits theaters on Feb. 4, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBursCmZKaZopyys62MoqVmppWsequtwqSYrKtdory3tcQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nigerian-newspapers-daily-front-pages-review-sunday-13-march-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Nigerian Newspapers Daily Front Pages Review</span></a>
