Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa and others for the unspent electoral term of office of May 29, 2019 to May 28, 2013.”</p><p>They also sought an order compelling the defendants to swear in Gusau as governor on PDP’s platform to complete the tenure of office, among others.</p><p>The FHC had, on July 19, 2021, restrained the House of Assembly from proceeding with its planned impeachment of Gusau as deputy governor.</p><p>Despite the order of the court, Gusau was impeached by the House of Assembly after receiving the report of the investigative panel constituted by the chief judge, Kulu Aliyu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FqZpuqlZa4qrrGZpqoraKperTA0aKinqtdpMK1ecauqpqto2K2rrzEmpqhpZWjwW6%2BxKyrqKqVqHqptcxmmKxlqpa6p63RmmSdnaCqwbp5xqitnqqepL9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1204009-best-prayers-quick-recovery-html.html><span>←</span><span>Best prayers for quick recovery</span></a>
