Protecting the right to a judicial recourse and due administration of justice is of utmost importance, being the cornerstone of an ordered society.</p><p>“Imposing impermissible conditions on Twitter would undermine the rights and interests of the Plaintiffs in the ECOWAS Court case filed against your government, as the conditions directly touch on the central issues of freedom of expression and access to information, which the court is set to determine and rule upon.</p><p>“Pushing conditions on Twitter while the ECOWAS case is pending would prejudice the interests of the Plaintiffs, undermine the ability of ECOWAS court to do justice in the case, damage public confidence in the court, and prejudice the outcome of the case.</p><p>“It is in the public interest to keep the streams of justice clear and pure and to maintain the authority of the ECOWAS court in the case. If not immediately withdrawn, the conditions would seriously undermine Nigeria’s international human rights obligations including under ECOWAS treaties and protocols, and have serious consequences for the public interest.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49sZputmJa%2Fqr%2BMnKannJmptrC60mamp2WkrLa1wMSrZKyto6Wyr7%2FIqKVmrZ6nsqK%2FzqeYm6SVYsCmvsCpZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-i-dont-sanctify-myself-when-playing-movie-roles-that-involve-going-into-a-coffin-kanayo-o-kanayo-opens-up.html><span>←</span><span>Why I Don't Sanctify Myself When Playing Movie Roles That Involve Going Into A Coffin</span></a>
