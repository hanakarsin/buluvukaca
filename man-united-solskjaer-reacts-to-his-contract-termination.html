For the club, for the fans, for the players, for the staff. I wanted us to take the next step to challenge for the league, to win trophies.”</p><p>Showing gratitude to the club management and fans for the moments he had shared with them, Solskjaer added: “I want to thank the board and the owners for giving me the opportunity because it’s not for everyone and I’ve had the opportunity.</p><p>“I’m so honoured and privileged to have been trusted to take the club forward, and I really hope that I leave it in a better state than when I came.</p><p>“I think there is potential in this club. We all love the club, and we all want to see it continue.”</p><p>According to Solskjaer, he had an interactive moment with Unied’s players on Sunday morning to encourage them to prove they are better than they have showed in recent weeks in Spain.</p><p>He said: “As I’ve said to them this morning as well, trust yourselves, you know we’re better than this.</p><p>“We’ve not been able to show it but go out, chest out, enjoy being a Man United player, in the Champions League, on the biggest stage. If and when you win the game, you’re through to the next round.</p><p>“Michael is going to be in charge. Michael, I have the utmost respect, I love Michael to bits. I’m becoming emotional now because he’s top. They’ll be fine. I’ll watch them and support them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FqZqaZnmLCr7XTnptmq5%2BhwKy2wJ6pZqqVlrC1v4ytpmagmah6pLvNramam6Riwaa%2BzKKlmqyZpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./report-reveals-why-there-is-less-investment-in-power-sector.html><span>←</span><span>Report Reveals Why There Is Less Investment In Power Sector</span></a>
