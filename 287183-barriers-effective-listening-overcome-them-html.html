What do you think are the barriers to effective listening? Today’s society has been saturated by information technology systems that have rendered good communication skills like effective listening a thing of the past as people communicate through messaging apps and social feedback sites. It is usually a tendency of people to listen while doing something else or even speaking with someone else all at the same time. This is not effective listening skills. Without effective listening skills, people tend to give replies and conclusions to statements made by the speaker without reasoning hence making rather inaccurate judgments. Ineffective listening is the main cause of communication breakdown. This post has covered various barriers to communication and how individuals can overcome them.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs3nsuiiim365.jpeg><p class=align-left>When talking about having excellent communication skills people often mention several factors that make effective communication but rarely do you hear listening as being one of the key contributors to effective communication. However, the most important and crucial skill under effective communication skills is listening. Listening is not hearing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/75deafb0067f3b63.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The top 10 essentials of effective communication skills</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What is the difference between hearing and listening? According to Burley-Allen listening is more sophisticated and involves deep mental processes than hearing does. For Burley-Allen, listening requires that one invests more than just energy but also discipline.</p><p class=align-left>For a person to be an effective listener, they have to learn it through a process. Thus, effective listening is not a passive process but an active process that takes discipline and unwavering attention to what is being said by the speaker. Although most people would think that they can't be good listeners, the reality of the situation is that we collect more information in the surrounding environment through listening than we do through hearing. Therefore, the truth of the matter is, all people have the capability to be good listeners but most of us opt for passive listening. There are different barriers to effective listening. So where do you fall under? Are you the active listener or passive listener? Read on to know more about the barriers to effective listening and how to overcome them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/30fb47cab9fc697b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>She stopped texting me out of nowhere! 8 possible reasons why</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Types of communication skills in business</p><h2>1. Lack of training to be an effective listener</h2><p class=align-left>The society has not provided a formal system for learning about this crucial factor in the communion process. In our day to day lives, we rely on the natural processes to know how to listen but there is no definite process that provides us with a platform to learn about the best ways to listen. We go through the school system from the primary school, high school, and the university but at no stage do we find a curriculum dedicated to instilling skills for effective listening. Is this a challenge? Yes, this is a big challenge towards having a society that fosters healthy communication skills. The school system fosters communication by learning how to write but ignores the impact that listening has on enabling communication. The lack of a definite system for teaching on the effective listening skills, communication in the advanced stages of development especially at adulthood is marred with conflict.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/30b224b3f53c0379.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to catch a cheating spouse using technology</span></p></a><h3>Remedy</h3><p class=align-left>Communication skills should be introduced at the primary school level with emphasis on the need for effective listening skills. Learners should be taught about the best ways of listening at the very basic level of their education, for example, as early as in the lower primary school. This is the primary action in overcoming barriers to effective listening because it builds the initial foundation for effective listening.</p><h2>2. The speaking problem</h2><p class=align-left>The communication process has glorified speaking at the expense of listening. The world is full of great speakers who offer motivation and skill. However, do you know that the world is also made up of great listeners too? Think about charismatic leaders like Abraham Lincoln who was the former president of the United States; in his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speech</a> at Gettysburg, the media described Lincoln as the greatest speaker of all time.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking motivates action and gives us the public perception of greatness because of the insights we share when speaking. However, do you know that Lincoln was also a great listener? In the book Team of Rivals that made its debut in 2005, Doris Kearns <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">documents </a>that Lincoln was a great listener. This decision was informed by the choice of the cabinet. According to Doris, Lincoln was key in choosing great men to his cabinet who had different views and ideas and who were great achievers in the various areas of life so he could sit and listen from them and gather views from them before he could make decisions that were life-changing and development oriented.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bf5d7cc5e0d7c4d7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Minute writing: tips, examples and templates</span></p></a><h3>Remedy to speaking problem</h3><p class=align-left>Practice role speaking whenever you are dealing with another person or a group of people. Some of the notable examples are in the entertainment industry. When hosting shows, the shows that have the most entertaining aspect is the one where the host takes more time listening than they spend speaking back to the guest. Taking enough time to listen gives the host an opportunity to construct questions and elaborate on the life of the guest that is in the case of a talkative host.</p><h2>3. Prejudice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/75deafb0067f3b63.jpeg><p class=align-left>People have the tendency to filter what they want to hear and what they dislike hearing. However, these filters that we put on people creates a barrier to listening. One of such filters is prejudgment. It is difficult to listen to people we have already judged that we don’t like for various reasons only we can justify. We, therefore, block out all the information that these people speak. The tendency to ignore people is derived from within. Bias is almost similar to prejudgment and involves the decision to put some information on the acceptable side and keeping others on the dislike end.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9b4802e451c27a66.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best motivational speeches for students</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The more we care about a person, the more likely it is for us to listen to them and the opposite applies when we dislike them. Various <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">studies </a>have proven that prejudice is one of the main barriers and roadblocks to effective listening in the family. Teenagers will be more likely to listen to their parent depending on whether or not they like them. Some children will prefer listening to either of the parents because of their bias factor. While some would prefer their fathers, others would prefer their mothers depending on the side of bias they fall in.</p><h3>Remedy</h3><p class=align-left>Give people the chance to speak before you judge them. Also, practice self-control when dealing with people you dislike. Offer to listen before you judge anyone because your presumption may be false.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Importance of communication</p><h2>4. Fake attention to the speaker</h2><p class=align-left>Faking attention means passive listening where a person looks like they are paying attention to what is being said but they are actually avoiding it through thinking or doing something else that occupies their minds. For example, a person may be speaking to you about a topic like education while you are busy thinking about what to have for lunch or what to do after the meeting. Faking attention is a big barrier to effective communication and impedes a development of a topic or an understanding of a subject. To build up effective communication, one must avoid faking attention.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1bc3vq620du.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 important characteristics of a good leader</span></p></a><h3>Remedies to faking attention</h3><p class=align-left>Always make the habit to clear up your mind before you engage in any conversation with someone else. The best practice is to always assume that the person on the other end of the table has some information that you do not know at the time and which you need to know.</p><p class=align-left>Avoid the tendency of formulating replies when someone else is speaking. This creates a state of divided attention and will only make you another speaker in waiting as opposed to being a listener. If possible, takes notes of the points someone is making so that you can react to the points you find important enough to warrant an explanation.</p><h2>5. The noise barrier</h2><p class=align-left>Any sound that is unwanted in the course of a conversation is noise. The presence of noise makes listening impossible and speaking even more irritating. Noise is a barrier because the listener cannot capture all that the speaker is saying and this creates misunderstanding. It gets very frustrating to try and hold a conversation in a noisy environment because neither of the parties in the communication is comfortable enough to either listen or speak. The conversation becomes characterized by shouting and straining to listen which are some of the barriers to effective listening skills.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs4pil0dqne4k.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 key negotiation skills and techniques</span></p></a><h3>Remedies to noise</h3><p class=align-left>Whenever possible, avoid holding conversations in noisy environments because they can be avoided in most instances. If the noise is controllable for instance in a house setting, try and reduce the volume from the noise sources.</p><h2>6. Bringing unnecessary emotions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/30fb47cab9fc697b.jpeg><p class=align-left>Avoid feelings of anger and grief or hypersensitive feeling in the listening process. Many a time, the biggest barriers to effective listening are ourselves. You cannot listen to the other person if all you can think about is anger and fury. Also, the speaker will not appreciate speaking up if their emotions are causing them to overreact to the other person’s sentiments.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Causes of conflict in an organization</p><h3>Remedy to unnecessary emotions</h3><p class=align-left>The best solution to emotional barriers is to exercise calm in every situation. Before you react to what the other person has said, take a break and remove every thought of displeasure for their sentiments. Also, you can just avoid the conversation completely if you feel angry and you know you cannot pay attention to what the other person is saying. Exercising restraint is the best solution for dealing with emotions as a barrier.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1htuvm7ie528.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Quotes about change in life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These are the six main barriers to effective listening. There are others like a misunderstanding, the rear of the other person, distractions, feeling tired, and preoccupation. Remember, it’s not just listening, but having an unwavering attention towards what is being said is what makes one an effective listener.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Bl3BocWtdl66zvsieqaxllZuzpq%2FToq2eZZyewLWxzaKloGWfq7Kzr86mnGasmJq6b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-disregard-circulating-list-tinubu-apc-still-working-on-presidential-campaign-council.html><span>←</span><span>'Disregard Circulating List, Tinubu, APC Still Working On Presidential Campaign Council'</span></a>
