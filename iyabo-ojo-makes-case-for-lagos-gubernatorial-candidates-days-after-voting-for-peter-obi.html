My Take</p><p>“1. APC: Though this party has never been my prerogative, but give it to Mr Sanwoolu, I have no issues with his achievements and his government. What I find hazy and can’t shake off is how the unfortunate endsars saga played out. I maintain he should have done better.</p><p>“2. PDP: If I were to be sentimental, I would take back my words & certainly pitch with my dear friend Funke, but i must see beyond emotions. so I am unable to make a fair judgment.</p><p>“3.
