They do not smile, and neither do they laugh or make silly faces.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e9a29b3d7e162028.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare at me but never smile? What it means and what to do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is also known as deadpan humor, with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">deadpan meaning</a> that the joke cracker is very impassive and has a matter-of-fact tone with no or the least display of emotions.</p><p class=align-left>The joke may be a mere statement that the person is making about a current situation or occurrence. The outrageous and cleverly implied manner in which they make the statement makes it so funny and sometimes challenging to understand.</p><p class=align-left>Normally, it is not funny and is context or situation-dependent. A witty person says things and feeds <a href=#>jokes</a> into every situation without even knowing that they are being funny.</p><p class=align-left>When someone asks, "What is dry humor?" it is essential to note that it is "supposed" to be condescending by its name and nature. For this reason, most people have the misconception that the person delivering the joke is also naturally condescending and arrogant.</p><p class=align-left>While this may be true in some cases, it should be understood that the person is merely putting an air of superiority and patronizing behavior so that their joke has the desired effect on the audience.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/8ce36936ad81548c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>No response is a response: how to deal with their silence</span></p></a><p class=align-left>NB: It is the responsibility of the person <a href=#>cracking the joke</a> to ensure that their words do not take a toll on someone who is not as good a <a href=#>sport</a> as he is expected to be. This type of humor does not necessarily need to be offensive or obscene.</p><p class=align-left>There is a fine line between dry humor and arrogant, senseless humor, which only intelligent minds <a href=#>can</a> decipher and use to their benefit.</p><p class=align-left>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chris Forrest</a>, a popular South African comedian famous for his dry jokes, he describes what a dry sense of humor means. He said:</p>The best way to describe it is when making a joke without making it obvious that you're making a joke. Normally, when I make jokes, especially in day-to-day life, I maintain a very serious face, and often, people aren't sure if I'm joking. Most people who know me know I am joking 90 percent of the time. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/61392ca26f953949.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best one-liners to get a laugh out of your friends or crush</span></p></a>An example that I always find funny wasn't really a joke, but we were on holiday on a relative's farm, and we were trying to give one of his calves, a baby cow, an injection. And then they were struggling to get the needle in, and I jokingly said, this thing's got skin like leather because, as you well know, leather comes from cows, and then my father-in-law looked at me like I was an idiot, and he's like this is leather, Chris.<p class=align-left>While acknowledging the influence of some comedians in his development, Chris attributes his dry humor to a natural style. He said:</p>It's just how I am. I've always been like this. I'm not sure why I think I was just born this way. But there are comedians I enjoy who have a similar sense of humor, people who influenced me: Jack D, Stephen Wright, and Milton Jones, who's less famous than the other two. More recently, I enjoyed a guy called Nate Bargatze from America.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/066c770223fd9a1d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Down bad" meaning: here is your new slang term of the week</span></p></a>I've got a couple of favorite shows I've written.

He said:</p>Many times, actually. Often, people think I'm being serious when I'm not. And then oftentimes, you have to explain to people that you're joking.My brain automatically goes into joke mode, which is sometimes inappropriate. A friend of mine got robbed once, and when I spoke to him, I said: Can you speak, or you're a bit held up. Which he laughs about now, but at the time, he didn't think it was funny.Normally, it's just explaining to people that you are joking and going from there, but people often take me seriously when I am just kidding around. You explain you're joking.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/39810c81fa79c47d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Funny quotes to lighten the mood for when the going gets tough</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Legit.ng recently published an article explaining what <a href=#>"golden retriever boyfriend" </a>means and where the term originated from.</p><p class=align-left>According to the Urban Dictionary, a golden retriever boyfriend is a laid-back companion who can sustain a joyful, loving relationship.
