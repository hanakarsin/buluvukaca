Toktam parked her car next to his to unload a table, she says, and Rajon allegedly shouted at her — with his face mask slipping under his nose — when he saw that she had inadvertently blocked his driver’s side door. “B--h, why do you think you can park here?” Rajon shouted, according to the lawsuit obtained by TMZ.</p><p>Then, Toktam claims, Rajon “pushed and shoved [Toktam] against her vehicle,” and Toktam says the push was “so violent and forceful that her sandal shoe flew off her foot and her keys, which she held in her hand, flew out of her hand and broke into two pieces when the key fell onto the ground.” Then, Rajon’s girlfriend allegedly “proceeded to repeatedly physically attack [Toktam] by striking her in the area of her head and upper body” after getting the “green light” from Rajon, according to the suit.</p><p>Now Toktam — who claims to have surveillance footage of the alleged incident — says she has a “permanent disability” and is seeking unspecified damages in excess of $1 million, per TMZ. But Mark D. Baute, Rajon’s attorney, tells the site that Toktam’s case “meritless.”</p><p>“I have seen the videotape,” he adds. “Mr. Rondo was polite throughout the encounter. The claimant was not wearing a mask and was unstable and rude. We look forward to defending the case and winning.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rajon has been dating fashion mogul Latoia Fitzgerald.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Latoia Fitzgerald (@latoiafitzgerald_)</a></p></figure><p>The TMZ report doesn’t name Rajon’s girlfriend, but as of October 2020, the four-time NBA All-Star was in a relationship with Latoia Fitzgerald, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Heavy.com</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Latoia, the creator of Lionne Clothing and Dillonger Clothing, posted videos of herself with the basketball star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>as recently as November</u></a>, when she commemorated the couple’s travels to the United Arab Emirates and the Maldives.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The basketball star signed the Hawks in November 2020.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rajon Rondo (@rajonrondo)</a></p></figure><p>At the time of the alleged incident, Rajon was still a Lakers player, and he helped the team clinch the 2020 NBA championship in October 2020.
