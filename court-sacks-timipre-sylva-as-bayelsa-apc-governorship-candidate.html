Justice Donatus Okorowo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, gave the verdict in a judgement delivered on Monday in the suit filed on June 13, 2023, by a member of the APC, Deme Kolomo against Sylva’s candidacy.
Delivering judgement in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/821/2023, Okorowo held that allowing Sylva to contest the November 11 governorship polls would be against the constitution of the country which states that no person should be voted for as a governor more than twice."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
