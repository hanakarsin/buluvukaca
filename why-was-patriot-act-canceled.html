The show covered timely political and cultural events while having a comedic edge. Recent episodes covered the coronavirus crisis, George Floyd‚Äôs death at the hands of police officers, and the 2020 election. During its run between October 2018 and June 2020, the show was met with much critical acclaim and even won an Emmy for Outstanding Motion Design.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What a run. <a href=#>@patriotact</a> has come to an end.

Sources stressed to Variety that when it comes to renewal decisions for any program, Netflix heavily weighs viewership against the cost of production.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans were bummed to hear the news of ‚ÄòPatriot Act‚Äô being canceled.</h2><p>Many fans were disappointed to hear the news that Patriot Act was getting the ax, especially since host, Hasan Minhaj, was such a strong voice. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>One fan wrote</u></a>, ‚ÄúWait, Patriot Act has been cancelled? This is such a shame. Hasan was doing something needed and special, and spoke with such authority and clarity about issues centering South Asians.

They wrote, ‚ÄúI really think Netflix is setting these weekly shows up to fail. It's trying to encourage a viewing style that Netflix itself rendered obsolete. Patriot Act was incredible and would have done so much better if people understood how they needed to watch it.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6edaaqmaokam%2FqrvTZpicrF2Yrq%2BvxKWcnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1187297-masanaantar-kannywood-jarumin-fina-finan-hausa-ya-rasu-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Masanaantar Kannywood: Jarumin fina-finan Hausa ya rasu</span></a>
