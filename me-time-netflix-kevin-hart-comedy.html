Though these two longtime friends couldn't be more different, Sonny's conservative personality combined with Huck's "free-spirit" attitude leads these two on a hilarious journey.</p><p>Writer and director John Hamburg spoke exclusively with Distractify about working alongside the comedian to develop Sonny's persona. With Kevin in the driver's seat, the Along Came Polly writer revealed that he had extensive conversations with the actor to fit Kevin's "specific voice."

"Kevin has such a specific voice that, for whatever reason, I think he and I work well together and I was able to capture it," he said.</p><p>As for Mark, the duo approached the actor to play the role of "wannabe George Clooney," Huck. Though the internet can't stop talking about Mark's nude scene in the film, John told us that it's the "little things" that Mark added to his character that really made them laugh, such as when Mark calls someone "stupid" in the film.</p><p>"That cracked Kevin and myself up," John laughed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Netflix's 'Me Time' cast Ilia Isorelýs Paulino and Andrew Santino talk improved and funny moments on set.</h2><p>The hilarity of Me Time comes from not just John's writing and Kevin's oneliners, but the supporting cast's improved moments and comedic timing.</p><p>"John likes to keep a very loose set and he's very trusting of his actors," actress Ilia Isorelýs Paulino told us. "If you have an idea, where you have an impulse, you know, it's just like balls to the wall. Just go," she said when asked about improvised lines in the movie.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>For Andrew Santino, the actor specifically remembers a scene in which his character has to blame his son for telling a lie. "The poor kid actor didn't know that I'd be calling him out," he said, adding, "His face was so genuine. ... I put him on the spot."</p><p>Throughout his performance, Andrew claimed that he channeled "all the dads out there who are dorks but think they're cool."</p><p>With so many hysterical one-liners, it's easy to imagine the cast laughing and breaking character while filming scenes together.</p><p>As for who was the first person to break on set, Ilia shared that Kevin is the one that "breaks the most." Adding, "He'll laugh at his own joke ... he's a funny dude."</p><p>Me Time is available to stream on Netflix on Aug. 26.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforJuwMimnGamlamzrbXXZqKerpmjeqmt0a1knKedmrG6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-doctors-tv-show-2020.html><span>←</span><span>Where Did All of the Doctors Go on 'The Doctors'?</span></a>
